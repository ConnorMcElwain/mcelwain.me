## Chapter 5.3 - Windows Autopilot Scenarios

### Windows Autopilot - Scenarios
* Organization Type
* Progress moving to Windows 10/11
* MEM Migration State
* Scenario:
	* Windows Autopilot User-driven Mode
		* Join device to AAD
		* Enroll in Intune
		* Require user credential for Azure AD join and Intune enrollment
		* Challenges:
			* More user wait time. This can be reduced using the white glove process
		* User Criteria:
			* Don't have on-prem dependency for applications and AD policy
			* Recommended for remote users who don't have access to corporate on-prem network
	* Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying Mode
		* Join device to AAD
		* Enroll in Intune
		* No need to provide user credential to authenticate for Intune and Azure AD join. Instead, a TPM chip is used for authentication
		* Challenges:
			* N/A
		* User Criteria:
			* Don't have on-prem dependency for application and AD policy
			* Recommended for Windows 10 kiosk scenarios or shared devices
	* Windows Autopilot Reset
	* Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployment
	* Windows Autopilot Deployment for Existing Devices

### Windows Autopilot - Scenarios
* User-Driven Mode
	* Join device to AAD
	* Enroll in Intune
	* Require user credential for Azure AD join and Intune enrollment
	* Challenges:
		* More user wait time. This can be reduced using the white glove process
	* User Criteria:
		* Don't have on-prem dependency for applications and AD policy
		* Recommended for remote users who don't have access to corporate on-prem network
* Self-Deploying Mode
	* Join device to AAD
	* Enroll in Intune
	* No need to provide user credential to authenticate for Intune and Azure AD join. Instead, a TPM chip is used for authentication
	* Challenges:
		* N/A
	* User Criteria:
		* Don't have on-prem dependency for application and AD policy
		* Recommended for Windows 10 kiosk scenarios or shared devices
* Hybrid Azure AD Join
	* Join Device to on Prem AD + registered in azure
	* Enroll in Intune
	* Require user credential for AAD and Intune enrollment
	* Challenges:
		* Require Intune connector to be installed for AD Join
		* More end user wait time
	* User Criteria
		* Recommended for users who have an on-prem dependency for apps and policy
* Existing Devices
	* Join device to AAD
	* Enroll in Intune
	* Require user credential for AAD and Intune enrollment
	* Can Copy Offline Autopilot profile
	* Challenges:
		* Require task sequence
		* More end user wait time. This wait time can be reduced using the white glove process
	* User Criteria:
		* Recommended for users who don't have an on-prem dependency
		* This approach can be used if company wants to achieve a mass OS rollout

### Windows Autopilot - Scenarios
* Windows Autopilot User-Driven Mode
	* Scenario:
		* Deploy and configure devices so that an end user can set it up for themselves
* Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying Mode
	* Scenario:
		* Deploy devices to be automatically configured for shared use, as a kiosk, or as a digital signage device
* Windows Autopilot Reset
	* Scenario:
		* Redeploy a device in a business-ready state
* Windows Autopilot for Pre-Previsioned Deployment
	* Scenario:
		* Pre-provision a device with up-to-date applications, policies, and settings
* Windows Autopilot Deployment for Existing Devices
	* Scenario:
		* Deploy Windows 10/11 on an existing Windows 7 or 8.1 device
