# Microsoft Endpoint Manager Notes
## Chapter 6.2 - Azure Device Identities

### Azure AD - Registered Devices
* Must have an Azure Active Directory Account
* Access limited based on AAD account and Conditional Access policies
* Managed through MDM tools like Microsoft Intune
* MDM enforces configurations
* AAD registrations is done when accessing a work application for the first time or manually using the Windows settings menu

### Azure AD - Azure AD Joined Devices
* AAD and Intune enforce configurations:
	* Requiring storage to be encrypted
	* Password complexity
	* Software installation
	* Software updates
* AAD join can be used in scenarios such as:
	* Transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure using AAD and MDM
	* When on-prem domain join is not possible
	* Primary access to Microsoft 365 or other SaaS apps integrated with AAD
	* Managing a group of users in AAD instead of in Active Directory
	* To provide joining capabilities to workers who work from home or are in remote branch offices with limited on-premises infrastructure
* Goal of AAD joined devices is to simplify:
	* Windows deployments of work-owned devices
	* Access to organizational apps and resources from any Windows device
	* Cloud-based management of work-owned devices
	* Users to sign into their devices with their Azure AD or synced Active Directory work or school accounts

### Azure AD - Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices
* Use Azure AD hybrid join devices if:
	* You support down-level devices running Windows 7 and 8.1
	* You want to continue to use Group Policy to manage device configuration
	* You want to continue to use existing imaging solutions to deploy and configure devices
	* You have Win32 apps deployed to these devices that rely on Active Directory machine authentication

### Azure AD - Device Registrations
* Azure AD join in Managed or Federated Environments
	* Cloud Experience Host (AAD Join Web App)
		* Endpoint Discovery
		* JSON OpenID doc
		* Build sign-in request
		* Collect Username/Password
		* Realm Discovery
		* JSON realm doc
		* POST Credentials
		* ID Token
		* User accepts MDM tou
		* DRS Discovery
		* Discovery Data Document
			* Generate TPM bound device keys and signed certificate request (dkpub/priv)
			* Derive transport key from TPM storage root key (tkpub/priv)
		* ID token, cert request, tkpub, attestation data
		* Write device object
		* Device cert
		* Install device cert in computer personal store
			* Validate ID token
			* Create device ID and cert
			* Write device object
	* Azure AD
	* Azure DRS
	* Intune
* Hybrid Azure AD join in Managed Environments
	* Automatic-Device-Join Task
		* User signs in w/ Password
		* LDAP query
			* Service Connection point in configuration partition
		* LDAP response
		* Create self-signed cert
		* LDAP write
			* Computer's userCertificate attribute
		* Generate TPM bound device keys and signed certificate request (dkpub/priv)
		* Derive transport key from TPM storage root key (tkpub/priv)
		* Device cert
		* Install device cert in computer personal store
	* Active Directory
		* Authentication using userCertificate*
		* ID Token
		* Detect attribute change on computer
		* userCertificate object GUID Computer SID
	* AAD Connect
		* ID token, cert request, tkpub, attestation data
		* userCertificate object GUID Computer SID
	* Azure AD
		* Write device object
	* Azure DRS
		* Update device object
			* Validate ID token
			* Create device ID and cert

### Azure AD Joined Devices and SSO
* When a user signs in to an AAD joined device:
	* Azure AD sends the details of the on-prem domain info back to the device with the token
	* The local security authority (LSA) service enables Kerberos and NTLM authentication on the device
* SSO allows on an AAD joined device:
	* Access to a UNC path on an AD member server
	* Access to an AD member web server

### Topic Summary
* Azure Device Identities
	* Azure AD registered Devices
	* Azure AD joined Devices
	* Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
	* Device registration flows
	* SSO to on-prem resources
