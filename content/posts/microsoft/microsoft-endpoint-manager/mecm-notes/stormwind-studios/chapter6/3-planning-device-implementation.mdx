# Microsoft Endpoint Manager Notes
## Chapter 6.3 - Planning Device Implementation

### Plan Your Azure AD Join Implementation
* Things to consider:
	* Review your scenarios
	* Review your identity infrastructure
	* Assess your device management
	* Understand considerations for applications and resources
	* Understand your provisioning options
	* Configure enterprise state roaming
	* Configure Conditional Access

### Managing Users on Azure AD Joined Devices
* Managing Local Admin Groups:
	* Azure AD adds the following security principals to the local admin group on the device:
		* Azure AD global administrator role
		* Azure AD joined device local administrator role
		* User performing the Azure AD join
	* Adding Azure AD roles to the local administrator role allows you to update the users that manage a device anytime in AAD without modifying anything on the device
* Managing Regular Users:
	* To prevent regular users from becoming local administrators:
		* Windows Autopilot
		* Bulk enrollment

### Plan Your Hybrid Azure AD Join Implementation
* Things to consider:
	* Review supported devices
	* Review things you should know
	* Review targeted deployment of hybrid Azure AD join
	* Select your scenario based on your identity infrastructure
	* Review on-premises AD UPN support for hybrid Azure AD join

### Configuring and Verifying Hybrid Azure AD Join
* Configuring Hybrid Azure AD Join:
	* Ensure devices have access to the Microsoft websites from inside your network
		* This may require a proxy or use Web Proxy Auto-Discovery
	* Use Azure AD Connect to configure Hybrid Azure AD join for a manage domain
		* Make sure to complete the steps for SCP (Service Connection Point) configuration
	* For a federated environment, use an identity provider that is supported
		* Recommended to use AD FS
* Verifying Hybrid Azure AD Join:
	* Locally on the device using PowerShell
		* `Dsregcmd /status`
		* Verify both **AzureADjoined** and **DomainJoined** are set to YES
	* Using Azure Portal
		* If **Registered** column says "Pending", the join hasn't completed
		* If **Registered** column contains a date/time, the join has completed
	* Using PowerShell
		* `Get-MSolDevice`
		* Value for **DeviceTrustType** is **Domain Joined**
