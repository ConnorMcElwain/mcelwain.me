# Microsoft Endpoint Manager Notes
## Chapter 3.2 - Organization of Configuration Manager

### Configuration Manager - Hierarchy Topology
* Size Matters!
	* Small:
		* Single Standalone Primary Site
	* BIG:
		* CAS - Central Administration Site (Group of connected primary and secondary sites)

### Configuration Manager - Standalone Primary Site
* Simplified administrative overhead
* Simplified client site assignment and discovery of available resources and services
* Elimination of possible delays introduced by database replication between sites
* Option to expand a standalone primary site into a larger hierarchy with a central administration site

### Configuration Manager - Stand-Alone Primary Site Size Considerations
* Stand-Alone Primary Site
	* Supports up to 15 MPs
	* Supports up to 250 DPs (combined total of 5000 DPs)
	* Supports up to 175,000 - not to exceed:
		* 150,000 Windows clients
		* 25,000 devices that run macOS
		* 50,000 devices managed by using on-prem MDM
* Secondary Site
	* Supports 1 MP
	* Supports 250 DPs
	* Supports up to 15,000 Windows clients
* Management Point
	* Supports 25,000 total clients and devices - not to exceed:
		* 25,000 Windows clients
		* One of the following (not both)
			* 10,000 devices that are managed by using on-prem MDM
			* 10,000 devices that run macOS

### Configuration Manager - When to use a CAS?
* CAS is the top-level site in a hierarchy
* CAS supports only primary sites as child sites
* CAS cannot have clients assigned to it
* CAS doesn't support site system roles that directly support clients
	* Management Points and Distribution Points
* Configure discovery operations throughout the hierarchy from the CAS
* Manage security throughout the hierarchy
* Configure replication to control communication between sites
* Size Matters!

### Configuration Manager - Central Administration Site (CAS)
* Supports more than one primary site
* Supports up to 25 primary sites
* Always locked into the central administration site
	* Cannot detach a child primary site to make it a standalone primary site

### Configuration Manager - CAS Size Considerations
* CAS
	* Up to 25 child primary sites
	* Supports up to 700,000 Windows desktops, 25,000 devices that run macOS and 100,000 devices using Mobile Device Management
* Primary Site
	* Up to 250 secondary sites
	* Supports up to 250 distribution points
	* Can support up to 2000 pull distribution points
	* With combining all secondary sites, can support up to 5000 distribution points
	* Supports up to 15 management points
	* In a CAS supports 150,000 clients and devices
* Secondary Site
	* Can support up to 250 distribution points
	* Can support up to 2000 pull distribution points
	* Should be 500 or more clients
	* Supports a single management point
	* Supports up to 15,000 Windows clients
* Management Point
	* Support 25,000 total clients and devices
* Distribution Point
	* Supports up to 4000 clients
	* Supports a combined total of up to 10,000 packages and applications
* Fallback Status Point
	* Supports up to 100,000 clients

* CAS - When and how to use it
* Stand-Alone Primary Site
* Site System Roles
