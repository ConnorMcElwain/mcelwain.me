# MS-102 Certification Notes
## Day 3.4 - Identity Models and Org Settings

### Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly Known as Azure AD)
* Authentication Provider for the Tenant
* Feature rich cloud first platform:
	* App integrations and Single sign-on
	* Passwordless and multifactor authentication
	* Identity protection
	* Privileged identity management
	* End-user self-service
	* Unified Admin Center
	* Integration with on Premise Active Directory
	* Integration with Azure Active Directory Federation Services

### When Tenancy is Created
* Tenancy Created
* Entra ID Provisioned
* First User Created
* Global Admin Role Assigned
* License Assigned
* `[tenant-name]`.sharepoint.com - public DNS configured
* `[tenant-name]`.onmicrosoft.com - public DNS configured
* `[username]`@`[tenantname]`.onmicrosoft.com email address provisioned in exchange online with working mailbox - public DNS configured

### Exam Note: Azure AD Free tenants (Entra ID Free)
* Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5
* Microsoft 365 Business Basic
* Microsoft 365 Business Standard
* Microsoft 365 Apps
* Office 365 F3
* Microsoft 365 F1
* This is a technicality in a way because they do use Entra ID (Azure AD) but the version doesn't include some of the advanced features so it really should be Free Azure AD, not Azure AD Free, but in case you run into this on the exam
* Also you can have many different licenses in the same tenant
