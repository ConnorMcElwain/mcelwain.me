### SharePoint Group Overview
* SharePoint Groups exist only in SharePoint
* The initial Groups Created are determined by the Site Template used to Create the First SharePoint Site in The SharePoint Site Collection
* Initial SharePoint Groups typically:
	* Owner - Full Control Permission Level
	* Member - Edit Permission Level (some templates assign the Contribute permission level to Members)
	* Visitor - Read Permission Level
* SharePoint Groups are administrated via the Advanced Permissions section of the Site Settings Page (typically from the Top-Level site of a Site Collection) or in the SharePoint Admin Center

### SharePoint Site Templates
* Currently there are 17 available (base) templates in SharePoint Online
	* Get-SPOWebTemplate | Sort Name | Out-Gridview
* SharePoint Site Templates are divided into 2 main categories:
	* Classic
	* Modern
		* Modern Team Site Template
		* Communication Site Template
* Create New Site Collection Page in SharePoint Online Admin Center (must have SharePoint Administrator permissions)

### SharePoint Site Collections for Microsoft 365 Groups
* SharePoint Site Collections can be configured to use Microsoft 365 Groups to manage access and membership
* This is the default behavior when creating a new Microsoft 365 Group
* This is the default behavior when creating a Microsoft Team
* When creating a Microsoft 365 Group or a Microsoft Team a new Site Collection is created with the Top-Level Site based on the Modern Team Site Template
