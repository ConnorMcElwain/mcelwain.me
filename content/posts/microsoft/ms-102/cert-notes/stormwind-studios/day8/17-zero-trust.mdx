# MS-102 Certification Notes
## Day 8.17 - Zero Trust

### Zero Trust
* Zero Trust Principles
	* Verify Explicitly - always use all available data points to authenticate and authorize
	* Use least-privilege access - use Just in Time (JIT) and Just enough (JEA) risk based adaptive policies
	* Assume Breach - segment access to minimize attack radius. Verify encryption, use analytics and threat detection
* Zero Trust Defense Areas
	* Identities - strong authentication
	* Endpoints - ensure compliance and device health before granting access
	* Apps - monitor activity including discovery of shadow IT
	* Data - classify and label data, encrypt and protect
	* Infrastructure - least privilege access always, monitor to detect attacks or anomalies
	* Network - devices on a network not automatically trusted. Employ threat detection solutions
