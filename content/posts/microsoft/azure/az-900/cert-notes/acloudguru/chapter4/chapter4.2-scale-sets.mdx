## Chapter 4.2 - Scale Sets

### Definition
A group of identical, load balanced VMs.

### Benefits
* Multiple VMs
	* Simple to manage multiple identical VMs using a load balancer
* High Availability
	* If one VM fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
* Auto Scaling
	* Automatically match demand by adding or removing VMs from the scale set
* Large Scale
	* Run up to 1000 VMs in a single scale set
* No Extra Cost
	* No added cost for using scale sets

### Exam Tips
Scale sets are taking virtual machines to the next level. And keeping your sanity.
* Scale sets are identical VMs. They can be activated or deactivated as needed
* A baseline VM for the scale set ensures application stability. A baseline VM is what you copy to make up the scale set VMs
* As resource usage increases, more VMs are activated to take the load
* You only pay for the VM, storage, and networking resources you use. Nothing additional for scale sets
