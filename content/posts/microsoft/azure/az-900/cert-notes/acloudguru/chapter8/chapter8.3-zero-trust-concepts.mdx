## Chapter 8.3 - Zero Trust Concepts

### Classic Trusted vs. Untrusted Model
Trusted Perimeter
Trust boundary for secure access
* Example: Corporate network
* Restrict private access to secure networks
If you're on the internal corporate network, you have a higher level of trust to the sensitive resources restricted within the secure networks. By comparison, users and devices outside of that corporate network are considered to be non-trusted devices. So users, computers, and databases insides of our corporate network or our trusted perimeter are implicitly trusted, and anyone outside of that network is not trusted.

### Challenges with Trusted Perimeter Model
Must be on corporate network to access resources
* Remote work is a challenge
	* VPN is extension of trusted perimeter
* Mobile device access even more challenging
	* May require more advanced work arounds
Rogue user/malware inside trusted perimeter network can cause havoc
* Broad scope of access

### Enter Zero Trust
What is Zero Trust?
* All users assumed **untrustworthy** unless proven otherwise
	* Trusted by **identity**
	* Regardless of location (trusted/untrusted networks)
	* Least privilege access -- just enough permissions to perform job
	* Simplified, centralized management
Zero Trust = Trusted **Identities**, Not Location

### Zero Trust in Action
Access Microsoft 365 email, documents, and resources for remote workforce
* Access from anywhere
* Authenticate with identity, not over VPN
Centrally control access with Conditional Access policies
Allow access only from approved managed devices
* These devices can be used independent from any specific network location
