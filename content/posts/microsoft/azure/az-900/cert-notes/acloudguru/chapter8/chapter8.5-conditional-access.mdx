## Chapter 8.5 - Conditional Access

### Conditional Access Concepts
Authentication Protections beyond Username/Password
* If/then policy to grant access
	* If (user) meets these conditions (signals), then grant/block access to defined applications
* Often paired with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
	* Centrally applied MFA enforcement
		* Does not rely on end user enabling MFA

### How It Works
Create Conditional Access Policy
* Assign signals (conditions)
	* Users/groups
	* Application to grant/deny access
	* Location (IP)
	* Approved company devices
* Access decisions (grant/block access)
	* Grant access
	* Block access
	* Granting access, but **require** MFA

### Conditional Access Scenarios
* Enforce MFA for all administrators/all users
* Block sign-ins using legacy authentication protocols
* Grant access only to specific locations
* Require organization-managed devices for application sign-in

Requiring managed devices and specific locations can be independent from each other. For example, we can use organization-managed devices from any location, or we can optionally pair it with location-based conditions as well. You have flexibility to choose requiring specific locations, managed devices, or both. Overall, Conditional Access policies take security beyond a simple requirement of a username and password allowing us to also apply additional if/then statements or conditions in order to approve or deny access.
