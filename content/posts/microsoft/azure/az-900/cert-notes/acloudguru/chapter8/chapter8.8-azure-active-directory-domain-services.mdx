## Chapter 8.8 - Azure Active Directory Domain Services

### Limitations of Azure AD and Cloud Migrations
Migrate legacy applications over to the cloud. Older applications that are critical to running the business are typically unable modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0.
* Unable to use modern authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0)
	* Applications that do not use these modern application protocols are not able to properly integrate or authenticate with Azure Active Directory
Instead these applications require traditional Active Directory (AD DS) management/protocols
* Group Policy
* LDAP
* NTLM
* Kerberos

### Possible Solutions?
Continue using on-premises AD
* Sync to Azure AD with Azure AD Connect
Configure AD server on Azure VM
* Also known as **self-managed** AD DS
* You maintain/configure the operating system (OS)
Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
* **Managed** Active Directory Domain Services
* Provides classic AD features in a managed service
	* Group Policy, LDAP, Kerberos, domain join

### How Azure AD DS Works
Azure AD DS is a managed service
* No need for OS configuration/management
* Behind the scenes: two Windows domain controllers for high availability
Create unique namespace/domain name
* Example: aadds-companyname.com
* Standalone domain, **not** extension of on-premises AD domain
One-way sync from Azure AD to Azure AD DS
* Synchronize users, groups, and credentials
* Azure AD may also bidirectional sync with on-premises AD

### Azure AD DS Scenario
Lift and shift legacy enterprise application to Azure VMs
* Application does not support modern authentication, therefore cannot properly integrate with the Azure AD service
Requirement to integrate application with classic, cloud-hosted AD using managed services
Cloud-hosted legacy application authenticates with Azure AD DS
