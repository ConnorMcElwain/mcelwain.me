# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8 - Identity Services

### Authentication
* Making sure you are you
* Confirming identity
* First test for access

### Authorization
Authorization only comes after authentication. If you aren't authenticated, there will never be a question of authorization. Authorization takes your identity and asks, is this identity allowed access?
* Comes after authentication
* Do you get access?
* Granular control

### Access Management
* Authentication vs. Authorization
	* You must know the difference to create effective access management
* Keep out the unwanted
	* Access management is critical to ensure only the right people and processes have access
