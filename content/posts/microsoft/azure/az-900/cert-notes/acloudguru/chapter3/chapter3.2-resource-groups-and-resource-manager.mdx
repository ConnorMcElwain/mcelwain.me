## Chapter 3.2 - Resource Groups & Azure Resource Manager

### Resource Groups
Everything in Azure is inside a resource group, no exceptions! While all resources must be inside of a resource group, the resource groups themselves are not a resource.

### Resource Group Facts
* One Resource
	* Each resource can only exist in a single resource group.
* Add/Remove
	* You can add or remove resources to any resource group at any time.
* Move Resource
	* You can move a resource from one resource group to another.
* Multiple Regions
	* Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group.
* Access Control
	* You can give users access to a resource group and everything in it.
* Interact
	* Resources can interact with other resources in different resource groups.
* Location
	* A resource group has a location, or region, as it stores meta data about the resources in it.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
This is deployment and management services for Azure. If you interact with any of the resources on Azure, it goes through ARM.

### ARM Benefits
* Group Resource Handling
	* You can deploy, manage, and monitor resources as a group.
* Consistency
	* Deploying resources from various tools will always result in the same consistent state.
* Dependencies
	* Define dependencies between resources to make sure they don't get in a fight.
* Access Control
	* Built-in features in the ARM make it easy to assign access rights to users.
* Tagging
	* Tag resources to easily identify them for future scenarios. Tagging is a way to label individual resources.
* Billing
	* Use tagging to stay on top of billing for groups of resources.

## Summary
* Resource Groups
	* All resources belong to a resource group. It isn't a resource, but helps structure your Azure architecture.
* Azure Resource Manager
	* All interaction with Azure resources go through the ARM. It's the main Azure Architecture component for creating, updating, and manipulating resources.
