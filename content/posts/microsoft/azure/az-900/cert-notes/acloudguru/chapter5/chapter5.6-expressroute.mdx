## Chapter 5.6 - ExpressRoute

### Overview
If a company needs their data to be both On-premises and on Azure, it has to be highly available, and periodically migrated, then ExpressRoute is the must have connection from the company to Azure.

ExpressRoute doesn't go over the public internet, which means that the security of your data and infrastructure is better. You'll get a more reliable and faster connection that has lower latency compared to any standard internet connection.

If you need a private, secure, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection, directly from your data center or infrastructure to Azure, ExpressRoute is the service you want to use.
