### Networking Summary
* Virtual Network
	* A fundamental part of Azure. All services are connected to a VNet. Includes an IP address range and subnets. Belongs to a single region and a single subscription
* Load Balancer
	* Distributes and balances the incoming traffic to an application or network. Uses IP address and port number to determine the receiving VM in the backend pool
* VPN Gateway
	* Connects your Azure network with your on-premises network securely
* Application Gateway
	* Distributes incoming traffic based on HTTP request properties, such as URL and host headers. Same session traffic can be handled by multiple servers
* ExpressRoute
	* Direct link between on-premises and Azure . Enables a private, secure, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection
* Content Delivery Network
	* Stores a cached version of your application on an edge node. Provides better performance and less traffic to your main server. Content cache is updated as necessary
