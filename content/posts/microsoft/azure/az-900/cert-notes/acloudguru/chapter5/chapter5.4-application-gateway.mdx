### Exam Tips
An application gateway is a higher level load balancer.
* It works on the HTTP request of the traffic, instead of the IP address and port
* Traffic from a specific web address can go to a specific machine
* Is a fit for most other Azure services
* Supports auto-scaling, end-to-end encryption, zone redundancy, and multi-site hosting
