# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10.9 - Azure Dedicated Hosts (Supplemental)

### Dedicated Hosts
* Hardware Control
	* You get control of an entire physical server on Azure
* Yours and Yours Alone
	* Physical layer isolation means you won't get any "foreign" VMs on your dedicated host
* Maintenance
	* Reduce impact on your system by choosing when to install updates to your dedicated host

### Cloud Benefits
* Compliance
	* Take advantage of the stringent Azure compliance in combination with managing your own hardware
* Global Infrastructure
	* Availability zones, fault isolation, high availability, and scale sets come as standard. No optional extras here
* OS of Your Choice
	* Choose Windows, Linux, or SQL Server on a range of VM sizes. Even save money by using your own licenses
