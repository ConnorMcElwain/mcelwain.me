# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 1.11 - Introduction Quiz

#### Question 1
* What is a PowerShell cmdlet?
	* A piece of advice from Microsoft about PowerShell updates
	* A PowerShell scripting language specifically for Azure
	* A lightweight version of PowerShell that can run on mobile devices
	* **A lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment to perform an action**

Cmdlets make up the majority of Azure features for PowerShell. This makes it easier to be consistent and efficient when interacting with Azure resources. PowerShell works with many different services.

#### Question 2
* Which of the following is NOT a key advantage of using ARM templates for creating cloud infrastructure?
	* **Faster processing in the Azure Resource Manager**
	* Idempotency
	* Source control
	* Declarative

All Azure tools, from the portal to SDKs, go through ARM at the same speed.

#### Question 3
* Which of the following is NOT a use case for the Azure mobile app?
	* **It is a replacement for using the Azure portal for everyday tasks, such as creating resources and analyzing Azure Monitor logs.**
	* It is great for receiving alerts and basic troubleshooting from anywhere you have an internet connection.
	* Interact with your Azure resources via Azure Resource Manager.
	* Maintain insight on the go into the current status and health of your Azure environment.

The main purpose of the Azure mobile app is to monitor the state of your Azure resources. It's not a replacement for the Microsoft Azure portal, where you can build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud applications in a single, unified console.

#### Question 4
* What is a primary advantage of using the Azure CLI?
	* The Azure CLI can be used with multiple cloud providers.
	* **You can use scripts to perform multiple tasks at once.**
	* Using the Azure CLI reduces the cost of using Azure.
	* The Azure CLI commands never change.

The Azure CLI allows you to write scripts that automatically execute multiple actions in Azure. This can increase efficiency and reduce the chance of errors.

#### Question 5
* What are some of the limitations with a free Azure account?
	* Azure free accounts are only valid in certain promotional periods, such as when new services are launched.
	* A free account only allows access to all services for 30 days, after which only free services are available.
	* You can only create a free Azure account with a US address.
	* **Included Azure credits will expire after 30 days, and included free popular services expire after 12 months.**

When you start using Azure with a free account, you get USD200 credit to spend in the first 30 days after you sign up. In addition, you get free monthly amounts of two groups of services: popular services (which are free for 12 months), and more than 55 other services (which are free always).

#### Question 6
* Which of the following best describes the key advantages of using ARM templates for creating cloud infrastructure?
	* Faster processing in the Azure Resource Manager and Idempotency
	* Service integrations and Declarative nature
	* Source control and Service integrations
	* **Idempotency, Declarative nature, and Source control**

ARM templates are idempotent, meaning you can execute a template any number of times with the same result. They are declarative, so you only specify what you want to create, not how. Azure takes care of the how. Lastly, you can use source control to track changes to the ARM template over time, which can help identify any issues that come from changes to the template.

#### Question 7
* What is a primary use case for the Azure mobile app?
	* The Azure mobile app is primarily used for analyzing Azure Monitor logs.
	* **It is great for receiving alerts and basic troubleshooting from anywhere you have an internet connection.**
	* The Azure mobile app is primarily used as a replacement for the Azure portal for everyday tasks.
	* The Azure mobile app is mainly used for creating new Azure resources.

The Azure mobile app is designed to provide alerts and allow for basic troubleshooting on the go. It provides a convenient way to monitor the state of your Azure resources from anywhere.

#### Question 8
* Why would you use the Azure Cloud Shell?
	* You can update the Cloud Shell independently of Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.
	* The Cloud Shell is free for 12 months.
	* The Cloud Shell gets new features first.
	* **Cloud Shell enables access to a browser-based command-line experience built with Azure management tasks in mind.**

Cloud Shell is 100% browser based and provides a complete environment where you can choose between Bash or PowerShell.
