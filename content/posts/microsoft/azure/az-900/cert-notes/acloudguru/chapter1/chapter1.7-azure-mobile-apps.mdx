## Chapter 1.7 - Azure Mobile Apps

### Platform
The Azure Mobile app is available on iOS and Android.

### Features: Home Screen
The home screen shows you immediate information such as alerts, recently used resources, the health of your system, and favorite resources. It's an excellent tool for a quick diagnose/troubleshooting any issue on the go.

### Features: Azure Resource Manager
The mobile app also utilizes Azure Resource Manager to interact with your Azure resources. This means it's in sync with the Azure CLI/Azure Portal.

### Features: Cloud Shell
You can even use a version of the cloud shell on the mobile app to run PowerShell or Azure CLI commands.
