## Chapter 11 - Governance

Governance validates that your organization can achieve its goals through effective and efficient use of IT.

### What's a policy?
A policy is a set of rules, rules to make sure that standards and agreements within your corporation are followed and that resources are compliant with these policies.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Define User Access
	* You can define specific user access to individual resources
* Minimum Access
	* RBAC can enable minimum access necessary to resources. This ensures only users with valid access can manage resources
* Target Specific Use Cases
	* Be very explicit about uses and access. For example, allow an application access to certain resources or allow a user to manage resources in a resource group

### Role-Base Access Control - Role Assignment
* Security Principal
	* An object representing an entity such as a user or group, which can access the resource
* Role Definition
	* A collection of permissions such as read, write, and delete
* Scope
	* The resources the access applies to. Specify which role can access a resource or resource group

### Locks
* Assigning
	* Assign a lock to a subscription, resource group, or resource
* Types
	* A lock can be of two types. Delete, where you can't delete the locked object. Read-Only, where you can't make any changes to the object
* Locked Means Locked
	* A lock needs to be removed before the locked actions can be performed again
