# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 11.3 - Monitoring Tools

### Monitor All the Things!
Azure includes multiple monitoring tools to gain full visibility into your Azure environment:
* Log Analytics
* Application Insights
* Azure Monitor Alerts

### Log Analytics
* Azure Monitor generates **A LOT** of logs and telemetry data
* Log Analytics stores and queries (or analyzes) that data to gain valuable insights
	* Examples:
		* VM disk size
		* VPN connection logs
		* Long term analysis
		* Combine metrics for complex queries

### Queries in Log Analytics
* Choose between pre-built and custom queries
* Queries in Kusto Query Language (KQL) format
	* KQL is the querying language used to query different types of logs in Log Analytics. SQL is similar (the syntax is a little bit different)
  
### Application Insights
* Performance insights for web applications
* Answers questions:
	* "How are users using out app?"
	* "Where are our performance bottlenecks?"
	* "Why are we getting website errors?"

### Application Insights (Continued)
* Web apps only
* Available for App Service, Azure VMs, and non-Azure resources
	* VMs require installed agent
* Application Insights scenario
	* Find performance bottlenecks in web application
	* Discover how users are using the website

### Azure Monitor Alerts
When something breaks, alert someone to fix it!
Notifications in response to unexpected events:
* Examples:
	* VM unresponsive
	* VM using excessive CPU
	* Application latency over 500 ms

### Alert Components
* Alert Rule
	* Monitored resource
	* Monitored telemetry
	* Conditions to trigger alert
	* Assigned severity
* Rule Example
	* Monitored resource: VM
	* Monitored telemetry: CPU utilization
	* Condition: > 90% CPU for 5 minutes
	* Severity: 2 - Warning
* Action group = action(s) taken when rule is triggered
	* Notification targets
		* Email/SMS to support personnel
		* Send to automation workflows (Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and more)
In all scenarios, when something is not working as expected, Azure Monitor alerts inform the right group to do something about it!
