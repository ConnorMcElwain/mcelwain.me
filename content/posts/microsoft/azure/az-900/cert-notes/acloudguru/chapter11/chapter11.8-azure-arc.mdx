## Chapter 11.8 - Azure Arc

### The Challenge of Managing Complex Environments
Computing resources in multiple locations
* Microsoft Azure
* On-Premises
* Other Clouds (AWS, GCP)

Each computing source uses its own management tools
* More locations = more management overhead
* Cannot apply Azure governance policies to non-Azure resources

What if we could:
* Manage both Azure and non-Azure resources in the same interface?
* Apply Azure governance policies to non-Azure resources?
Solution: Azure Arc

### What's Azure Arc?
* Technical definition:
	* Centralized governance and management for on-premises and multi-cloud computing resources
* Simplified definition:
	* Manage non-Azure resources as if they were in Azure
	* Extend Azure cloud management and services to non-Azure locations

### How It Works
How Azure Arc works is that it effectively extends the Azure control management to our non-Azure locations. It works by installing an agent on these non-Azure computing resources to bring it into Azure's control plane. As a result, you Azure access and management is effectively extended from Azure to your non-Azure resources using Azure Arc as your bridge or connection between your non-Azure locations and Azure as well.

### Benefits of Azure Arc
* Manage Azure and non-Azure resources in the same place
* Manage non-Azure Kubernetes clusters
* Deploy Azure-managed database services to non-Azure locations
	* Example: Azure SQL Managed Instance
* Manage and protect non-Azure servers
	* Monitor non-Azure OSs alongside Azure VMs
	* Protect with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
	* Apply Azure Automation runbooks
* Apply Azure governance
	* RBAC
	* Azure Policies
	* Azure Blueprints
* Deploy Azure serverless services to non-Azure hardware
	* Azure App Service
	* Azure Functions
	* Azure Logic Apps
	* And more

### Scenario
You maintain servers in both Azure and an on-premises datacenter.
* You want to apply Azure management services (Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy) to these servers
