# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 6.3 - File

### On-Premises
Most companies will have file shares that're used to storage all of the companies assets. Users will upload, delete synchronize, do whatever they need to do to work with the files. Having on-prem can provide some issues:
* Issues
	* Disk Space Constraints
		* You only have a limited amount of storage
	* Backups
		* Time and resources spent on maintaining backups
	* Security
		* It can be hard to keep all data secure at all times. Specialist assistance often needed
	* File Sharing
		* Can be difficult to share files across teams and organizations

### File Benefits
All of the previously mentioned issues (for on-prem) can be resolved:
* Sharing
	* Share access to the Azure file storage across machines and provide access to your on-premises infrastructure
* Managed
	* You don't have to worry about hardware or operating system
* Resilient
	* Network and power outages won't affect your storage

### Scenarios
* Hybrid
	* Supplement or replace your existing on-premises file storage solution
		* Azure comes with redundancy and backup features as standard
* Lift and Shift
	* Move your existing file storages and related services to Azure
