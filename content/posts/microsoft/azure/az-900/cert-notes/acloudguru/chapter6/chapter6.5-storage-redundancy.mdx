## Chapter 6.5 - Storage Redundancy

Accidents Happen! These could be in the form of **Hardware Failure** such as a corrupted disk. Or accidents can have a wider scope in which an entire location (Zone/Regional Outage) is temporarily unavailable. For these scenarios, the concept of data redundancy can protect against these unplanned accidents/failures.

### Importance of Data Redundancy
##### Redundancy: Multiple, Replicated Copies of Data
If one copy fails/is inaccessible, data is still available.
Azure Storage always creates multiple copies of your data:
* Automatic
* **Minimum** of three copies
* Invisible to end user

### Multiple Redundancy Options
* Different location scopes
	* Single zone
	* Multiple zones
	* Multiple regions
* Higher availability = higher cost

### Redundancy Options at a Glance
* Single Region
	* Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
	* Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
* Multi-Region
	* Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
	* Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)

All options include:
* **Three copies** in primary region
* **Three copies** in secondary region (multi-region options)

### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
Three copies in a single location (datacenter/zone)
* Lowest-cost option
* Protect against single disk failure
* **Does not** protect against zone or regional outage

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
Three copies across three availability zones
* One copy in each zone
* Protect against zone outage, but **not** regional outage

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
Three copies in two different regions
* Three copies in primary regional physical location (LRS)
* Three copies in secondary (paired) region physical location (LRS)
* Protect against primary region failure, but no primary region zone redundancy
* Can configure read access from secondary region for high availability
	* In the event of a primary region failure, the failover process of accessing your data from the secondary region will be relatively much quicker than if we had this option disabled

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
Maximum redundancy!
* Copy across three availability zones in **primary** region (ZRS)
* Three copies in secondary region physical location/zone (LRS)
* Protect against primary region failure AND primary region zone failure
* Can also configure read access from secondary region for high availability

### Summing It Up
Azure Storage automatically replicates data for redundancy
* Three copies in single region
* Six copies across two paired regions
	* Three in each region
Redundancy options vary by availability and cost
* Single zone
* Multiple zones in a single region
* Across regions
	* Single/multi-zone in primary region
