## Chapter 6.1 - Blob

Blob means "Binary Large Object"

### Storage Levels
These blobs of data are stored in containers, inside the storage account. There are three layers to Blob storage: storage account, container, and then blob.

A blob container is like a mixed bag of items that're all labeled in a sensible manner.

### Scenarios
* Images
	* Store various sizes and formats as a single image storage
* All Types
	* Store any kind of files and have distributed access through the Azure cloud storage
* Streaming
	* Stream audio and video directly from your blob storage
* Log files
	* Write to log files regardless of size and frequency
* Data Store
	* Store any kind of data at scale, such as for archiving, backup, restore and disaster recovery

### Blob Types
* Block
	* Store text and binary data up to 4.7TB. Made up of individually managed blocks of data
* Append
	* Block blobs that are optimized for append operations. Works well for logging where data is constantly appended
* Page
	* Store files up to 8TB. Any part of the file could be accessed at any time, for example a virtual hard drive

### Pricing Tiers
* Hot
	* Frequently accessed files. Lower access time and higher access costs
* Cool
	* Lower storage costs and higher access times. Data remains here for at least 30 days
* Archive
	* Lowest costs and highest access times
