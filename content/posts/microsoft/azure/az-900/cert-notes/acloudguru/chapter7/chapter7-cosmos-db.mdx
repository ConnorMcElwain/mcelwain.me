# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7 - Cosmos DB

### Global From The Go
One of the key parts to Cosmos is its ability to be global from the start, and with the click of a button. This is important because having data near your users is the key to providing the best experience to your users.

### Synchronization
* Easy with Cosmos
	* Traditional databases that weren't cloud enabled could be very difficult to set up across multiple regions. Azure takes care of all of it with Cosmos
* One Click to Add Regions
	* It's very easy to expand to more regions with Cosmos DB and have the data stay in sync
* Continued Synchronization
	* Cosmos DB stays on top of all reads and writes to your data and makes sure data is moved between regions to stay in sync

### Latency
Latency is the time it takes for data to travel. The higher the latency, the longer it takes data to reach the user. Cosmos DB promises 0-9 milliseconds of latency anywhere in the world.

### Scalability
* Automated
	* Cosmos DB automatically scales to meet resource demand
* Infinite Resources
	* Any number of users of your application can be supported
* Lowest Price
	* Even though the scaling is automatic, you only pay for the resources you use

### Connectivity
* Developer
	* Choose from various software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs)
* Languages
	* A language for most modern developers, including C#, Java, and Node.js
* Platforms
	* Choose from lots of data platforms to integrate with, including SQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra

### Warning!
One of the pitfalls with Cosmos DB is that it can get really expensive. You get what you pay for, but costs will increase as Cosmos DB scales up. Costs can run up quickly!
