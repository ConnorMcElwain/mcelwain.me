# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.2 - Azure SQL

### Managed Service
Azure SQL is in effect a database as a service. As with other fully managed services, Azure will take care of your hardware and infrastructural level needs. That includes servers, storage, network, and everything else infrastructure-related. Azure SQL sits on top and provides you with the business logic and functions you need. Think of Azure SQL as a fully fledged database solution, where Azure is managing all the parts that don't have anything directly to do, with managing the data in the database.
