### Question 1
* What is the response time for Severity B on the Professional Direct support plan?
	* Within one hour
	* Within four hours
	* Within eight hours.
	* **Within two hours**

You may think this question is needlessly specific, but Microsoft loves to test students on the support matrix and you will likely get a question like this on the exam.

### Question 2
* What kind of questions and answers can you find in the Azure Q&A articles?
	* A selection of the Azure documentation and articles found on TechNet.
	* Over 100,000 user-submitted questions and answers.
	* Architectural diagrams, whitepapers, and in-depth technical articles on how to get the most out of your Azure resources.
	* **Common questions asked when first starting to use Azure.**

The Azure Q&A articles provide answers to a range of the most commonly asked questions. In particular, the focus is on foundational answers or answers to popular questions that are seen again and again.

### Question 3
* How do you submit a support ticket?
	* Through the Azure Support Portal, which comes with any paid support plan
	* Through the phone number for your region and support level, as noted in the Azure portal
	* Through the email addressÂ support@azure.com, making sure you add your account ID in the subject line
	* **Through the Azure portal**

A support ticket is submitted through the Support section of the Azure portal. Depending on your support level, you will have various options to submit billing, technical, and other kinds of support tickets.

### Question 4
* How do you sign up for a service-level agreement with Azure?
	* Fill out the form on the Microsoft Azure main support page.
	* Call the regional support number as provided in the Azure portal to discuss the desired level of the agreement.
	* **Service-level agreements are included with every Azure paid service automatically.**
	* In the Azure portal, go to the service in question and click on the Service Level Agreement section.

Service-level agreements are implicit for all Azure paid services. You get an SLA included with every subscription level and support level. In general, there are no SLAs associated with free products on Azure.

### Question 5
* What is one of Microsoft's most recommended support channels for Azure?
	* Sending a direct email to the Azure support team.
	* Calling the customer service number for your country/region.
	* **Azure documentation**
	* Posting a question on a non-Microsoft technical forum.

Azure documentation is a highly recommended support channel as it provides comprehensive and up-to-date information about Azure services.
