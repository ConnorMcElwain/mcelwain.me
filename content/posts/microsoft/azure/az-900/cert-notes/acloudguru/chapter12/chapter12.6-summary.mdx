* Subscriptions
	* Every resource belongs to a subscription. An Azure account can have multiple subscriptions. Billing admins control costs. Management groups help you keep track of many subscriptions in an account

	* Use free accounts and Azure Cost Management to keep costs as low as possible and optimize resources
* Pricing Factors
	* Resource size, resource type, location of the service and bandwidth used all affect the price of a service. Azure Pricing Calculator and Total Cost of Ownership Calculator can help predict costs
* Best Practices
	* Use spending limits, quotas for services, tags to order resources and reserved instances to manage costs and get the best price
