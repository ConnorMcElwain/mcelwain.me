# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 12.7 - Pricing Quiz

### Question 1
* What are the key features of Azure Cost Management?
	* Recommendations to move services between Azure regions to save on cost.
	* Automatic shutdown of services that haven't been used for a set period of time.
	* **Visualizing current and future costs for your Azure account.**
	* Potential discounts through gamification of using best practices.

Azure Cost Management is a part of the Azure portal that can visualize your current and future costs. It also includes tools for financial governance to make sure you don't get unexpected costs from incorrect use of Azure resources. There are no discounts, gamification, or automatic shutdown services.

### Question 2
* Which of the following factors influence the cost of using products and services on Azure?
	* **Bandwidth usage, resource size, and the location of the service or resource.**
	* The age of the resource and bandwidth usage.
	* The location of the service or resource and the age of the resource.
	* Resource usage (the more you use it, the cheaper it gets) and resource size.

The cost of a service on Azure is influenced by factors such as the amount of bandwidth used, the size of the resource, and the location of the service or resource. The age of a resource or how much it is used do not directly influence the price.

### Question 3
* Which of the following factors does NOT influence the cost of using products and services on Azure?
	* **The age of the resource.**
	* The location of the service or resource.
	* How much bandwidth you will use.
	* Resource size.

Your costs are not reduced because the resource is older.

### Question 4
* Which Azure calculator would you use to figure out monthly costs for Azure services?
	* Total Cost of Ownership Calculator
	* Azure Portal Service Estimation
	* Azure Service Calculator
	* **Azure Pricing Calculator**

The pricing calculator for Azure is a comprehensive tool you can use to estimate any combination of services on Azure. The Total Cost of Ownership Calculator can indicate the savings achieved by moving your on-premises services to Azure. The Azure portal can only estimate costs of existing services that you have in your account.

### Question 5
* What is a recommended best practice in Azure to prevent spending over a certain credit amount?
	* Monitor frequently used services, and keep track of any excess usage via the Azure Spending Manager
	* Use the subscription credit limits, which are built into all Azure subscriptions
	* **Use Azure spending limits on Azure free accounts or subscription types that include credits over multiple months**
	* Use Azure Alerts to get notified of when spending exceeds the subscription limits

The spending limit in Azure prevents spending over your credit amount. All new customers who sign up for an Azure free account or subscription types that include credits over multiple months have the spending limit turned on by default. The spending limit is equal to the amount of credit. You can't change the amount of the spending limit. For example, if you signed up for Azure free account, your spending limit is $200 and you can't change it to $500. However, you can remove the spending limit. So, you either have no limit, or you have a limit equal to the amount of credit. The limit prevents you from most kinds of spending. The spending limit isnâ€™t available for subscriptions with commitment plans or with pay-as-you-go pricing. For those types of subscriptions, a spending limit isn't shown in the Azure portal and you can't enable one.

### Question 6
* What is a major factor that influences the cost of using products and services on Azure?
	* Resource usage (the more you use it, the cheaper it gets).
	* The age of the resource.
	* The color of the resource.
	* **Resource size.**

The size of a resource is a major factor that influences the cost of a service on Azure. Larger resources typically cost more than smaller ones.

### Question 7
* What does Azure Cost Management allow you to visualize?
	* **Current and future costs for your Azure account.**
	* Potential discounts through gamification of using best practices.
	* Recommendations to move services between Azure regions to save on cost.
	* Automatic shutdown of services that haven't been used for a set period of time.

Azure Cost Management is a part of the Azure portal that allows you to visualize your current and future costs. It also includes tools for financial governance to make sure you don't get unexpected costs from incorrect use of Azure resources. There are no discounts, gamification, or automatic shutdown services.
