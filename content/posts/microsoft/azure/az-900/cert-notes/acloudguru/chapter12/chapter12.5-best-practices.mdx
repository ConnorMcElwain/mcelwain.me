# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 12.5 - Best Practices

### Spending Limits
* Default Limit
	* Some Azure accounts with monthly credits to use will have default spending limits. When the credits are used, the limit kicks in
* No Increase
	* When the credits are gone, either remove the limit entirely or leave it in effect
* No Spending Limit
	* Pay-as-you-go accounts have no spending limit functionality

### Quotas
* Property Limit
	* A quota is a limit on a certain property of an Azure service. For example, a maximum of 100 namespaces for Event Hub
* Ensure Service Level
	* The quotas are necessary to ensure Azure can maintain their high service level
* Quota Change
	* If you need to increase the quota for a particular service, you can ask Microsoft to increase them

### Tags
* Tags are non-functional labels that attach to a resource or resource group
* Use as many tags as you want

### Tags - Continued
* Identify Roles
	* Protect sensitive data by defining which roles can access a resource
* Related Resources
	* To make bulk processing and updating easier, define which resources are related
* Filter
	* Filter resources per project, customer or for reporting purposes
* Unambiguous
	* Create a list for tags used that includes: description, tag name, and potential values

### Pay-as-you-go
Pay-as-you-go = Expensive

### Reserved Instances
Reserved instances can save you a lot of money. Not all Azure services can be reserved.

### Reserved Capacity
* 1-or 3-Year commitment
	* Azure SQL
		* Save up to 80%
	* Synapse Analytics
		* Save up to 65%
	* Cosmos DB
		* Save up to 65%
	* Redis Cache
		* Save up to 55%
Change regions, scale up or down, apply it to multiple subscriptions, and cancel at any time.

### Azure Hybrid Benefits
Azure will let you use existing licenses instead of forcing you to purchase new ones with every new VM or server.

### Advisor
The Advisor portal gives you best practices advice in general through recommendations. For cost optimization, this could be a recommendation to scale down a virtual machine, removing networks you aren't using, and storage that is dormant.
