# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.5 - DevOps

DevOps is the work between development and production.

DevOps is at its core about people: how developers, engineers and system administrators organize themselves and work as a team to deliver better products faster.

### Azure DevOps
* Azure Boards
	* Keep track of work tasks, timelines, issues, planning and much more. Project managers love this part
* Azure Pipelines
	* Produce and test your software automatically and continuously
* Azure Repos
	* Store source code for your application securely in a managed way. Developers are big fans of this part
* Azure Test Plans
	* Design tests of applications to implement automatically. Quality assurance engineers love this
* Azure Artifacts
	* Share applications and code libraries with other teams inside and outside your organization
And it's FREE! To get started at least...

### Azure DevTest Labs
* Environment Management
	* Allow developers and engineers to create environments for test and development
* Cost Management
	* You won't incur unexpected costs and will even minimize waste of resources on your account
* Templates
	* Tailor your development and test environments and reuse them with templated deployments

### GitHub and GitHub Actions
* GitHub
	* Acquired in 2018 by Microsoft
	* code repository service for lots of big and small projects
	* A favorite among open-source communities
	* Microsoft themselves are one of the biggest users of GitHub
* GitHub Actions
	* Very similar to Azure Pipelines
	* Build code, test code, and publish code
	* Works with almost any platform, such as AWS, GCP, and many more
