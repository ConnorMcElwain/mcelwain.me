## Day 3.3 - Resource Tagging

### Resource Tagging
* Purpose of Tags
* Where you can apply tags
* Examples of tag usage
* Best Practices and Considerations

### Purpose of Tags
* **Metadata:** Tags provide additional information about your resources beyond their basic properties
* **Identification:** You can use tags to identify resources based on settings relevant to your organization
* **Logical Organization:** Tags allow you to group and categorize resources for better management

### Where You Can Apply Tags
* **Azure Resources:** You can apply tags to individual Azure resources (such as virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, etc)
* **Resource Groups:** Tags can be added to resource groups, helping you organize related resources within a group
* **Subscriptions:** Tags can also be applied at the subscription level

### Examples of Tag Usage
* **Environment Tag:** Suppose you want to track the deployment environment for your resources. You can create a tag with the key "Environment" and a value like "Production" or "Deployment"
* **Cost Allocation:** Tags help with cost allocation and budgeting. You can tag resources by project, department, or business unit
* **Lifecycle Management:** Use tags to indicate the lifecycle stage of a resource (e.g., "Testing", "Staging," or "Archived")

### Azure Tags and Tag Policies
* **Avoid Sensitive Values:** Tags are stored as plain text, so never add sensitive information (such as passwords) to tags
* **Case Sensitivity:** Tag names are case-insensitive for operations, but tag values are case-sensitive
* **Non-English Language:** Be cautious when using non-English language in tags, as it can cause issues with metadata retrieval
* **Tag Policies:** Azure Policy helps enforces organization-wide standards for tagging requirements
