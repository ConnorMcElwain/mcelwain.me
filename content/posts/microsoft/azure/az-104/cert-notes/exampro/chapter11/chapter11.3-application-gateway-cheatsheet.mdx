## Chapter 11.3 - Application Gateway CheatSheet

### Azure Application Gateway CheatSheet
**Azure Application Gateway** is **application-level routing** and **load balancing** service.
Application Gateway operates on **OSI Layer 7** also known as the Application Layer.
* **Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)** policies can be attached to an Application Gateway to provide additional security
An Application Gateway is composed of Frontends, Routing Rules, and Backends:
* Frontends you choose an address type
	* **Private IP** will create an Internal Load Balancer
	* **Public IP** will create a Public/External Load Balancer
* Backends you create Backend Pools
	* Backend pools
		* A backend pool is a collection of resources to which your application gateway can send traffic
		* A backend pool can contain, VMs, VM scale sets, IP addresses, domain names, App Services
* **Routing Rules** are composed of **Listeners, Backend targets, HTTP Settings**
	* **Listeners** "listens" on a specified port and IP address for traffic that uses a specified protocol
		* If the listener criteria are met, the application gateway will apply this routing rule
		* There are 2 types of listeners:
			* Basic - Forward all requests for any domain to backend pools
			* Multi-site - Forward requests to different backend pools based on **host header** and **host name**
		* Requests are matched according to the **order of the rules** and the type of listeners
			* Add your basic listeners last otherwise it will capture all requests
	* **Backend targets** chooses where a route should go either **Backend Pool** or **Redirection**
		* To create a rule for Backend Pool you need to create **HTTP Setting**
			* Defines how we want to handle cookies, connection draining, port request time out and more
