## Chapter 4.4 - RBAC

### Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage **who has access to Azure resources**, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.
* **Role Assignments** are way you control access to resources
* A Role Assignment consists of these **three** elements
	* Security principal
	* Role definition
	* Scope
* There are **four fundamental** Azure roles
* Azure RBAC includes over **70 built-in roles**

A Security Principal represents the identities requesting access to an Azure resource such as:
* User
	* An individual who has a profile in Azure Active Directory
* Group
	* A set of users created in Azure Active Directory
* Service Principal
	* A security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources
* Managed identity
	* An identity in Azure Active Directory that is automatically managed by Azure

**Scope** is the **set of resources** that access for the Role Assignment applies to. Scope Access Controls at the Management, Subscription, or Resource Group level.
* Management Group
	* Subscriptions
		* Resource Groups
		* Scopes
			* Resources

A Role Definition is a collection of permissions. A role definition lists the operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like owner, or specific, like virtual machine reader. Azure has built-in roles and you can define custom roles.
* These are the four fundamental built-in roles:
	* Owner
	* Contributor
	* Reader
	* User Access Administrator
