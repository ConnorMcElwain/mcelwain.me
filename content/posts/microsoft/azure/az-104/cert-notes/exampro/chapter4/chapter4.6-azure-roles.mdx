* Name

* IsCustom
	* (roleType) Indicates whether this is a custom role. (true or false)
* Description
	* (description) The description of the custom role
* Actions
	* (actions) An array of strings that specifies the management operations that the role allows to be performed.
* NotActions
	* (notActions) An array of strings that specifies the management operations that are excluded from the allowed Actions
* DataActions
	* (dataActions) An array of strings that specifies data operations the role is allowed perform to your data within that object.
* NotDataActions
	* (notDataActions) An array of strings that specifies the data operations that are excluded from the allowed DataActions
* AssignableScopes
	* (assignableScopes) An array of strings that specifies the scopes that the custom role is available for assignment. You can only define one management group in AssignableScopes of a custom role.
* Wildcard permissions
	* Actions, NotActions, DataActions, and NotDataActions support wildcards (*)
