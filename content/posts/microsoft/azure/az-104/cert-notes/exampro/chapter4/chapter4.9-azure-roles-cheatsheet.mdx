### Azure Roles CheatSheet
Within Azure there are 3 kinds of roles:
* Classic subscription administrator roles
	* This is the original role system
* Azure roles
	* Known as Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), built on top of Azure Resource Manager
* Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles
	* Azure AD roles are used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory
**Identity Access Management (IAM)** allows you to create and assign Azure (RBAC system) roles to users.
Roles restrict access to resource actions (also known as operations). There are 2 types of roles:
* BuiltInRole
	* Managed Microsoft roles are read only pre-created roles for you to use
* CustomRole
	* A role created by you with your own custom logic
**Role assignment** is when you apply a role to a user. A role assignment is composed of a Security Principle, Role Definition, and Scope. Azure's 4 built in roles are:
* Owner
* Contributor
* Reader
* User Access Administrator
**Classic Administrators have 3 types of roles**:
* Account Administrator
	* The billing owner of the subscription. Has no access to the Azure portal
* Service Administrator
	* Same access of a user assigned the Owner role at subscription scope. Full access to the Azure portal
* Co-Administrator
	* Same access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope​
**Important Azure AD Roles**:
* Global Administrator
	* Full access to everything
