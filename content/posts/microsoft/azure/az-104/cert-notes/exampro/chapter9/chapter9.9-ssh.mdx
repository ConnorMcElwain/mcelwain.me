# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.9 - SSH

### Secure Shell (SSH)
It's very common to use **SSH key pairs** as a mean to authenticate to your VMs. **SSH Key Pairs** is when you generate out two keys:
* A Private Key
* A Public Key
The private key should remain on your local system and not be shared with others. A public key is **stored on the VM**. **When you go to SSH**, you provide your private key and it's matched against the public key to authenticate you.
* Example: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub azureuser@10.111.12.123`
