# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.13 - Update Management

### Update Management
**Update Management** allows you to **manage and install operating system updates and patches** for both **Windows** and **Linux** virtual machines that are deployed in Azure, on-premises, or in other cloud providers.

When you launch an Azure VM you can go to **Operations** and turn on **Guest + Host Updates**. This will install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) that will be used to monitor your instances.

**Azure Automations** is the underlying service that is installed agent.
* Update Management will perform a scan for update compliance
* A compliance scan is by default, **performed every 12 hours** on a **Windows** and **every 3 hours** on a **Linux**
* It can take between **30 minutes and 6 hours** for the dashboard to display updated data from managed computers
In Azure Automation, you can enable the Update Management, Change Tracking and Inventory, and Start/Stop VMs during off-hours features for your servers and virtual machines. These features have a dependency on **a Log Analytics** workspace, and therefore require linking the workspace with an Automation account.
