# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.5 - ACUs

### Azure Compute Units
**Azure Compute Unit (ACU)** provides a way of comparing compute (CPU) performance across Azure SKUs.

ACU is currently standardized on a **Small (Standard_A1)** VM with the value of **100**. All other SKUs then represent approximately how much faster that SKU can run a standard benchmark.

* SKU Family
	* A1-A4
	* D1-D14
* ACU/vCPU
	* 100
	* 160-250
* vCPU: Core
	* 1:1
	* 1:1
D1-D14 are **60% to 150%** more performant than the A1-A4

### Practice Quiz
* ACU is currently standardized on a --- VM with the value of 100
	* Small (Standard_B1)
	* **Small (Standard_A1)**
	* Small (Premium_A1)
	* Medium (Standard_A1)
* How much more performant is the D1-D14 compared to the A1-A4?
	* 80% to 100%
	* 50% to 75%
	* 20% to 40%
	* **60% to 150%**

* What provides a way of comparing compute (CPU) performance across Azure SKUs?
	* **Azure Compute Unit (ACU)**
