# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9 - Introduction

### Azure Virtual Machines
Choose an OS, Compute, Memory, and Storage and launch a **server** in minutes.

### Introduction to Azure VMs
**Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** are a highly configurable server. Virtualization lets you run a server **without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware** that runs it.
* Virtual Machines still require maintenance such as:
	* Applying OS system patches
	* Installing and configuring packages

Some thing you should know:
* The **size** of the virtual machine is determined by the image
	* The image defines the combination of vCPUs, Memory, and Storage Capacity
* The current limit on a per subscription basis is **20 VMs per region**
* Azure VMs are billed at an **hourly rate**
* A single instance VMs has an availability of 99.9% (when all storage disks are premium)
* Two instances deployed in Availability Set will give you 99.95% availability

When you **launch** an Azure Virtual Machine other networking components will be either created or associated to your Virtual Machine.
* **Network Security Group (NSG)** - attached to the NIC, virtual firewall with rules around ports and protocols
* **Network Interface (NIC)** - a device that handles IP protocols and network communication
* **Virtual Machine Instance** - The actual running server
* **Public IP Address** - The address that you will use publicly access your VM
* **Virtual Network (VNet)** - The network where your VM will reside
