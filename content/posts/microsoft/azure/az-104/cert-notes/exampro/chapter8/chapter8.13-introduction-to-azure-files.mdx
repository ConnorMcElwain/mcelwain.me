# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.13 - Introduction to Azure Files

### Azure Files
**Azure Files** is a fully managed **file share** in the cloud. a file share is a **centralized server for storage** that allows **multiple connections**. (It's like having one big shared drive that everyone (Virtual Machines) can work on at the same time.)

To connect to the file share a **network protocol** is used:
* Server Message Block (SMB)
* Network File System (NFS)
When a connection is established, the file share's filesystem will be accessible in the specific directory within your own directory tree. This is known as **mounting**.
