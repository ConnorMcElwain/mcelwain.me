# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.19 - Azure Import Export Service

### Azure Import/Export Service
Used to securely **import large amounts of data** to Azure Blob storage and Azure Files **by shipping disk drives** to an Azure datacenter.

You have 2 options for shipping drives on import:
* Use your own disk drives
* Use **Microsoft** provided drives
Microsoft ships up to 5 encrypted solid-state disk drives (SSDs) known as **Azure Data Box Disk** with a 40 TB total capacity per order, to your datacenter through a regional carrier.

You can quickly configure **Azure Data Box Disk** drives, copy data to disk drives over a USB 3.0 connection, and ship the disk drives back to Azure.

To prepare your drive, you'll need to use the command-line **WAImportExport tool** to:
* Prepare your disk drives that are shipped for import
* Copying your data to the drive
* Encrypts the data on the drive with AES 256-bit BitLocker
* Generate the drive **journal files** used during import creation
* Helps identify numbers of drives needed for export jobs

There are two versions of **WAImportExport**:
* Version 1 for import/export into Azure Blob storage
* Version 2 for importing data into Azure files

**WAImportExport** tool is only compatible with 64-bit Windows

Once you have prepared your drives and generate journal files, you can create an Import Job

The **journal file** stores basic information such as:
* Drive serial number
* Encryption key
* Storage account details

* You'll specify Region and Storage Account
* You'll provide shipping information

For **export jobs** you:
* You can only export from Azure Blob
* You can ship up to 10 empty drives to Azure per job
* You create an export job and the data is loaded onto those drives and shipped back to you
