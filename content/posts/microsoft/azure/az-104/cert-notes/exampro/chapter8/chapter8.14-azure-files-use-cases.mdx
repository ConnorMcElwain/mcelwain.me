## Chapter 8.14 - Azure Files Use Cases

### Azure Files - Use Cases
* Use Cases
	* Completely **replace or supplement** on-premises file servers Network Attach Storage (NAS) devices
	* **Lift-and-Shift** your on-premise storage to the cloud via Classic Lift or Hybrid Lift
		* "Lift-and-Shift" means when you move workloads without rearchitecting, e.g. importing local VMs to the cloud
		* Classic Lift - Where both the application and its data are moved to Azure
		* Hybrid Lift - Where the application is moved to Azure Files, and the application continues to run on-premises
	* **Simplify cloud development**
		* Shared application settings - Multiple VMs and developer workstations need to access the same config files
		* Diagnostic share - All VMs log to the file share, developers can mount and debug all logs in a centralized place
		* Dev/Test/Debug - Quickly share tools for developer needed for local environments
	* **Containerization**
		* You can use Azure Files to persist volumes for stateful containers

Why use Azure files instead of setting up your own File Share server?
* **Shared Access** - Already setup to work with standard networking protocols SMB and NFS
* **Fully managed** - It's kept up to date with security patches, designed to scale
* **Scripting and Tooling** - You can automate the management and creation of file shared with Azure API and PowerShell
* **Resiliency** - Build to be durable and always working

### Practice Quiz
* Which Azure File Use Case is where both the application and its data are moved to Azure?
	* Diagnostic share
	* **Classic Lift**
	* Fully managed
	* Containerization
* Which Azure File Use Case is when multiple VMs and developer workstations need to access the same config files?
	* Containerization
	* Classic Lift
	* **Shared application settings**
	* Dev/Test/Debug
* Which advantage of Azure files over setting up your own File Share server is its already setup to work with standard networking protocols SMB and NFS?
	* **Shared Access**
	* Resiliency
	* Scripting and Tooling
	* Fully managed

* What is Lift-and-Shift (Azure Files)?
	* A Lift-and-Shift is when you move workloads without rearchitecting, eg. importing local VMs to the cloud.
* In Azure Files, what is the process where the application data is moved to Azure Files, and the application continues to run on-premises?
	* Hybrid Lift
