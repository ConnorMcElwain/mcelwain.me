# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.6 - Replication Data Redundancy

### Replication and Data Redundancy
When you create a Storage Account, you need to choose a **Replication Type**. Replication stores multiple copies of your data so that it's protected from:
* Planned events
* Transient hardware failures
* Network or power outages
* Massive natural disasters

The greater level of redundancy the more expensive the cost of replication:
* **Primary Region Redundancy**
	* Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
	* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
* **Secondary Region Redundancy**
	* Geo redundant storage (GRS)
	* Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
* Second Region **Redundancy with Read Access**
	* Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
	* Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)

### Practice Quiz

	* Tertiary Region Redundancy
	* **Primary Region Redundancy**
	* Secondary Region Redundancy
	* Secondary Region Redundancy with Read Access
* Which Replication Type includes Read Replicas?
	* Zero Region Redundancy
	* **Secondary Region Redundancy with Read Access**
	* Primary Region Redundancy
	* Secondary Region Redundancy

* What is Replication?
	* Replication stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned events, transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters.
* What is defined as the storing of the same data in multiple locations? E.g. Storing the same data on multiple data centers
	* Data Redundancy
