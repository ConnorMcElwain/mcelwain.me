## Chapter 8.5 - Access Tiers

### Access Tiers (Blob Storage)
There are **3 types** of access tiers for **Standard storage**: Cool, Hot, and Archive.
* Hot
	* Data that's accessed frequently
	* Highest storage cost, lowest access cost
	* Use Case:
		* Data that's in active use or expected to be accessed frequently
		* Data that's staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool access tier
* Cool
	* Data that's infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days
	* Lower storage cost, higher access cost
	* Use Case:
		* Short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets
		* Older media content not viewed frequently anymore, but is expected to be available immediately when accessed
		* Large data sets that need to be stored cost effectively while more data is being gathered for future processing
* Archive
	* Data that's rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days
	* Lowest storage cost, highest access cost
	* Use Case:
		* Long-term backup, secondary backup, and archival datasets
		* Original (raw) data that must be preserved, even after it has been processed into final usable form
		* Compliance and archival data that needs to be stored for a long time and is hardly ever accessed

* Account Level Tiering
	* Any blob that doesn't have an explicitly assigned tier infers the tier from the Storage Account access tier settings
* Blob-Level Tiering
	* You can upload a blob to the tier of your choice
	* Changing tiers happens instantly with the exception from moving out of archive
* Rehydrating a Blob
	* When moving a blob out of archive into another tier, it can take several hours. This is known as "rehydrating"
* Blob Lifecycle Management
	* You can create rule-based policies to transition data to different tiers e.g. after 30 days move to cool storage

When a blob is uploaded or moved to another tier, it's charged at the new tier's rate **immediately** upon tier change.
* When moving from a cooler tier:
	* The operation is billed as a write operation to the destination tier
	* Where the write operation (per 10,000) and data write (per GB) charges of the destination tier apply
* When moving from a hotter tier:
	* The operation is billed as a read from the source tier
	* Where the read operation (per 10,000) and data retrieval (per GB) charges of the source tier apply
	* Early deletion charges for any blob moved out of the cool or archive tier may apply as well

* Cool and archive early deletion
	* Any blob that is moved into the cool tier (GPv2 accounts only) is subject to a cool early deletion period of 30 days
	* Any blob that is moved into the archive tier is subject to an archive early deletion period of 180 days. This charge is prorated

	* **Blob-Level Tiering**
	* Rehydrating a Blob
	* Account Level Tiering

* Which access tier for standard storage stores data that is infrequently accessed, stores it for at least 30 days, and has lower storage cost, higher access cost?
	* Archive
	* **Cool**
	* Hot
	* Unlimited
* When a blob is uploaded or moved to another tier, it is not charged for 30 days.
	* **False**
	* True

* What is the access tier for standard storage: Hot?
	* It stores data that’s accessed frequently, has the highest storage cost and lowest access cost.
* What happens when you move from a **cooler tier** (blob storage)?
	* The operation is billed as a **write operation** to the destination tier where the write operation and data write charges of the destination tier apply.
