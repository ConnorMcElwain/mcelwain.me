# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10.3 - Disk Roles

### Azure Disks - Disk Roles
There are 3 main disk roles in Azure, the **data disk**, the **OS disk**, the **temporary disk**. It's possible to see these three roles via remote accessing your VM.

* Data Disk
	* A managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep
	* Registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter that you choose
	* Has a maximum capacity of 32,767 gibibytes (GiB)
	* The size of the VM determines how many data disks you can attach and the type of storage you can use
* OS Disk
	* Every virtual machine has one attached operating system disk
	* The OS disk has a pre-installed OS, which was selected when the VM was created
	* This disk contains the boot volume
	* This disk has a maximum capacity of 4,095 GiB
* Temporary Disk
	* Most VMs contain a temporary disk, which is not a managed disk
	* Provides short-term storage for applications and processes, and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files
	* Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM
	* During a successful standard reboot of the VM, data on the temporary disk will persist
	* The temporary disk is typically `/dev/sdb` on Linux and Windows VMs the temporary disk is `D:` by default
	* Not encrypted by SSE unless you enable encryption at host
