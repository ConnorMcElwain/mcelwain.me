# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 11.6 - Using Azure Kubernetes Service

### Traditional Azure Container Instances (ACI) Solution
* ACI Limitations
	* Scalability
		* Manual redeployment is required to scale up a container group
	* Management
		* Orchestrating multi-container container group solutions are cumbersome without an orchestration layer

### Kubernetes Container Solution
* Kubernetes Benefits
	* Scalability
		* Can easily scale containers to meet demand
	* Management
		* Provides an orchestration layer for clusters

### What Is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?
* AKS
	* What is it?
		* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a serverless platform for Kubernetes. It provides scalable container solutions
	* Why use it?
		* AKS abstracts away the management of a Kubernetes cluster by managing most of the deployment and orchestration
* AKS provides
	* Autoscaling
		* Pods and Clusters
	* Identity and Access Management
		* Azure AD Integration
	* Storage Volumes
		* Azure Storage
	* Networking
		* VNets, NSGs, and network policies

### Azure Kubernetes Service Features
* Management
	* Autoscaling of clusters and horizontal scaling of pods. Manage node pool configurations, and Kubernetes versioning and upgrades
* Identity
	* Provide access to AKS cluster using Azure AD identity objects and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Provide an identity for the cluster to manage underlying resources
* Networking
	* VNet connectivity integrated via kubenet or Container Network Interface (CNI). HTTP app routing available. Manage traffic using network policies
* Storage
	* Implement storage volumes that are either static or dynamic
* Registry
	* Store container images in Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, or other public/private repos. Docker images are supported
