# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.2 - Creating and Managing Virtual Machines (Part 2)

### Virtual Machine Architecture
* Resource Group
	* Virtual Network (VNet)
		* Subnet
			* VM
				* NIC
					* Private IP
					* Public IP
				* Disk
				* NSG

### Demonstration
* Create a Linux VM
	* Use Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and PowerShell via the Cloud Shell in the Cloud Playground
* Configure Disks
	* Add a data disk to the VM
* Configure Networking
	* Select/Create a VNet, subnet, NIC, PIP, and NSG
* Install a Webserver
	* Install Nginx using custom data
* Open NSG for HTTP
	* Manage security rules for the VM

### Use Cases
* Intended Purposes
	* Linux/Windows Compute
		* Deploy Linux/Windows virtual machines using Azure VM's IaaS model
	* Migrate Workloads
		* Migrate compute workloads to Azure. For example, move web servers to Azure VMs
	* Cloud Computing Solutions
		* Azure VM workloads with specific configurations and additional resources can provide solutions with high availability, fault tolerance, scalability, and elasticity

### Exam Tips
* Key Components
	* CPU/Memory
		* Sizing determines CPU and memory
	* Networking
		* VMs use VNets, NICs, and NSGs to determine connectivity
	* Storage
		* VMs use Azure Disks to storage OS, non-persistent, and persistent data
* Bonus Tip
	* Security for VMs can be managed by opening ports on a NSG (Network Security Group)
