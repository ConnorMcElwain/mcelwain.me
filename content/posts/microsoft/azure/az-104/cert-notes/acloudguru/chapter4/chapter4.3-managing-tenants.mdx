### Key Takeaways
Azure Active Directory is just a global service that spans the Azure cloud. You get to create your instance of that service known as a tenant inside of geographical regions like the United States. This meant that your tenant of Azure Active Directory will be running on servers allocated for Azure Active Directory global services, inside of that geographical region. Inside of the tenant is where all of your identity objects like users, groups, devices, applications are all going to exist. You use these identity resources to provide access to your Azure resources that are inside of Azure subscriptions.
