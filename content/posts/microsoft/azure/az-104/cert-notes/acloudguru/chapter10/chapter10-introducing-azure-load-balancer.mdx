# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10 - Introducing Azure Load Balancer

### Describing Azure Load Balancer
* Azure Load Balancer (LB)
	* Azure Load Balancer is a networking solution for distributing traffic between backend compute
		* Layer 4 load balancing (TCP/UDP)
		* High availability
		* Backend resources must be redundant
		* Virtual machines and VMSS

### Components of an Azure Load Balancer
* Frontend IP
	* Private or public endpoint for accessing the load balancing solution
* Backend Pool
	* Compute solution underlying the load balancer
* Health Probe
	* Probe that periodically checks the health of the backend pool to determine available nodes
* Rules
	* Load balancing or NAT rules configured for allowing inbound/outbound access

### Key Takeaways
* Load Balancing
	* Balance traffic between external or internal solutions
* Health Probing
	* Health check ports for nodes in the backend pool
* DNAT
	* Port forward inbound traffic to nodes in the backend pool
* SNAT
	* Port forward outbound traffic from nodes in the backend pool
* Availability Zones
	* Determine availability zone selection for deployment
