# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 3.3 - Understanding Azure Policy

### Define Azure Policy
* Enforce Compliance and Enable Auditing
	* Organizations need to implement enterprise-level governance and compliance capabilities
* Prohibit Resources
	* Control costs
	* Restrict service access
* Allowed Locations
	* Geographical compliance

### Components of a Policy
* Azure Policy
	* Policy Definition
		* Defines the evaluation criteria for compliance, and defines the actions that take place. Either audit or deny should be something outside of compliance
	* Policy Assignment
		* The scope at which we will assign our policy. The scope could be a management group, subscription, resource group, or resource
	* Initiative Definition
		* A collection of policies that are tailored to achieving a singular high-level goal together (e.g., ensuring that VMs meet standards)

### Policy Example
* Require Tags
	* Policy Definition
		* Evaluate if a VM is being created with our tag **Project: az104**. If the VM is missing the tag, then deny creation of the resource
	* Policy Assignment
		* Assign the policy at the scope of the resource group where the VMs will be created

### Key Takeaways
Azure Policy is used to enforce compliance and governance in our organizations. We do this with Azure Policy using various components. Such as a policy definition where we create, manage, and assign policies by making the next component, policy assignments. We take those policies that we've defined, now we assign them at a scope. Since we have assigned them at a scope, be that management group, subscriptions, or resource groups, we now have the ability to enforce those policies to enforce compliance on those resources.
* Create, manage, and assign policies
* Enforce compliance on resources
* Audit compliance
* Deny creation of resources outside of compliance
