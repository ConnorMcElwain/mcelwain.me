# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 3.6 - Managing Azure Costs

### What Impacts Costs?
* Subscription Type
	* Free, pay-as-you-go, Enterprise Agreement, and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)
* Resource Type
	* For example, storage account Blob storage vs. Table storage
* Usage Meters
	* Utilities like overall CPU time, ingress/egress network traffic, and disk size
* Resource Usage
	* The costs of actually using a resource
* Location
	* The costs for various services vary across geographical regions

### Cost Best Practices and Tools
* Best Practices
	* Select the appropriate resource for the use case
	* Understand resource needs (sizing)
	* Deallocate resources when not needed
	* Use cloud capabilities where possible (e.g., scalability, elasticity)
		* Scalability in cloud computing is the ability to quickly and easily increase or decrease the size or power of an IT solutions or resource
		* Elastic computing is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage.
	* Plan costs prior to purchase
* Cost Tools
	* Pricing Calculator
		* Can be used to create quotes of workloads that we define so that we understand how much they will cost us before we actually provision any of those resources
	* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator
		* This tool will help to understand how much workloads we have running on-prem would cost us if we were to run the equivalent workloads on Azure
	* Microsoft Cost Management
		* This tool allows to analyze costs by performing specific cost analysis functions
		* Helps to create budgets

### Key Takeaways
* Pricing Calculator
	* Estimate workload costs for prospective workloads
* TCO Calculator
	* Compare costs to determine cost savings between on-premises and cloud solutions
* Microsoft Cost Management
	* Analyze costs, apply filtering, and create budgets
