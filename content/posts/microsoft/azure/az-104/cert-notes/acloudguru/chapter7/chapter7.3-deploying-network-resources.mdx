# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.3 - Deploying Network Resources

### IP Addressing
* Private Connectivity
	* VNets can be used to provide private communications between resources
* Public Connectivity
	* VNets can be used to provide publicly resolvable address for resources
* IP CIDR Planning
	* Plan networks to prevent overlap in network address space to allow for network integration

### Types of IPs
* Private IPs
	* Statically or dynamically assigned addresses that allow private connectivity between resources
* Public IPs
	* Statically or dynamically assigned addresses that allow public connectivity from the internet to a resource

### Public IP SKUs
* Basic SKU
	* Statically or dynamically assignable PIP that is accessible by default and requires an NSG to restrict traffic. Does not support availability zone deployments
* Standard SKU
	* Statically assigned PIP that is not accessible by default and requires an NSG to allow traffic. Support availability zone deployments

### NIC IP Configurations
* Network Interface Card (NIC)
	* IP Configurations
		* Private IP: 10.0.0.4
		* Public IP: x.x.x.x

### Key Takeaways
* Network Interface Card (NIC)
	* IP Configurations

		* Public IPL x.x.x.x
* Private IPs
	* Statically or dynamically assigned addresses that allow private connectivity between resources
* Public IPs
	* Statically or dynamically assigned addresses that allow public connectivity from the internet to a resource
	* Two types of public IP SKUs:
		* Basic
		* Standard
