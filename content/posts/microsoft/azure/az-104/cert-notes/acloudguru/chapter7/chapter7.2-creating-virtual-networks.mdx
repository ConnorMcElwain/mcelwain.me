# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.2 - Creating Virtual Networks

### Designing a Network
* Determine IP CIDR
	* Select a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that allows for growth and integration
* Subnetting Requirements
	* Determine how to segment the solution to meet your needs, such as segmenting for n-tiers
* Connectivity Needs
	* Determine what type of connectivity is needed: Internet, resource to resource, resource to service, etc

### Virtual Network (VNet) Features
* Subnetting
	* Azure VNet uses subnets to segment address spaces. Reserved IP addresses are x.x.x.0-3 and x.x.x.255
* Private Networking
	* Azure VNet supports DHCP for private IP addressing for resources
* Public Networking
	* Azure VNet supports public IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6) so that resource can have public connectivity
* Peering
	* Azure VNet supports peering between Azure VNets
* Network Gateway
	* Azure VNet uses gateway subnets to make VPN connects
* Monitoring
	* Azure VNet makes monitoring easy. View logs, monitoring connectivity, and view a topology of the virtual network

### Key Takeaways
* Default Connectivity
	* By default, intra-network traffic and outbound internet traffic is allowed
* Address Restrictions
	* Use of private addresses using RFC 1918 provide best results. The smallest VNet/subnet size allowed is /29 and the largest is /8
* Reserved IPs
	* Azure reserved IPs are x.x.x.0-3 and x.x.x.255
* DNS and DHCP
	* Azure-provided DNS or custom DNS. For VNets, DHCP is built-in
* Network Integration
	* VNets are built for integration with one another, hybrid connectivity using VPNs, and ExpressRoute
* Supported Protocols
	* VNets support TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols
