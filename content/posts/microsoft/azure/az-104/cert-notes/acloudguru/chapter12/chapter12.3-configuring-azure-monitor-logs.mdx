### Key Takeaways
We have our Log Analytics Workspace as a repository for us to aggregate data to for our logs and metrics, when we configure logs inside of our diagnostic settings to send those logs and metrics to a Log Analytics Workspace. We can do things inside of Log Analytics Workspace such as visualize our data, as well as alert on the data that we're capturing. We also have something known as Insights which is used more for special use cases, focused insights that we get for specific services such as VMs and Application Insights.
* Data Sources
	* Azure resources, Azure AD tenant, subscriptions, and on-premises (custom) resources
* Log Analytics Agent
	* An extension installed on resources to allow for telemetry to be gathered into the workspace
