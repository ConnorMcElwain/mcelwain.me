# Microsoft Endpoint Manager Notes
## Chapter 5.4 - Windows Autopilot Capabilities

### Windows Autopilot - Capabilities
* Capabilities:
	* Windows Autopilot is self-updating during OOBE
	* Cortana Voiceover and Speech Recognition during OOBE
	* BitLocker Encryption
* Windows Autopilot User-Driven Mode
	* User-driven mode for Azure Active Directory Join
		* User can join devices to AAD
		* Create profile with desired settings
		* Create Device Group in AAD and assign the Autopilot profile to it
	* Additionally for each device:
		* Add the device to Windows Autopilot
			* Automatically by an OEM when the device is purchased
			* Manually harvesting
		* Ensure profile has been applied to device
			* Automatically through group assignments
			* Manually add
	* User-driven mode for Hybrid Azure Active Directory Join
		* Create Autopilot profile with "Hybrid Azure AD joined" specified
		* Create device group with that profile assigned to it
		* Create domain join profile including on-prem AD domain join info
		* Device must have internet access
		* Intune Connector for Active Directory must be installed (this connector will do the join instead of the user needing to have rights to do so)
		* WPAD Proxy settings option must be enabled and configured if using a proxy
	* Additional requirements for on-prem scenario for user driven Hybrid Azure AD join
		* Device must be Windows 10 version 1809 or later
		* Device must have access to an Active Directory Domain Controller and be connected to the network
	* User-driven mode for Hybrid Azure Active Directory Join with VPN Support
		* In addition to the aforementioned requirements
		* Supported version of Windows 10/11
		* Enable the "Skip Domain Connectivity Check" toggle in the Hybrid Azure AD Join Autopilot profile
		* A VPN configuration that:
			* Can be deployed with Intune and lets the user manually establish a VPN connection from the Windows logon screen, or
			* One that automatically establishes a VPN connection as needed
		* Confirm a user-driven Hybrid Azure AD join is possible on your network
		* Validate the VPN configuration can be deployed using Intune to an existing device that has already been hybrid Azure AD joined
* Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying Mode
	* Network connectivity
		* Ethernet connection requires no user interaction
		* Wi-Fi connection user must only
			* Choose the language, locale and keyboard
			* Make a network connection
	* Self-deploying mode provides all the following:
		* Joins the device to Azure AD
		* Enrolls the device in Intune using Azure AD for automatic MDM enrollment
		* Makes sure that all policies, applications, certificates and networking profiles are provisioned on the device
		* Uses the Enrollment Status Page to prevent access until the device is fully protected
	* Self-Deploying mode does not support AD Join or Hybrid Azure AD join - only Azure AD join
* Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying Mode - Requirements
	* TPM 2.0 hardware
	* TPM Device attestation
		* This require access to a set of HTTPS URL's that are unique for each TPM provider
	* Create Autopilot profile for self-deploying mode with desired settings
	* Create device group in Azure AD and assign the profile to that group
	* Boot the device, connecting to Wi-Fi if necessary
* Windows Autopilot Reset
	* Reset Devices with Local Windows Autopilot Reset
		* Quickly remove personal files, apps, and settings
		* Reset Windows devices from the lock screen
		* Apply original settings and management enrollment
	* Enable Local Windows Autopilot Reset
		* Configure the "DisableAutomaticReDeploymentCredentials" policy
	* Remote Reset of Devices
		* An MDM Service such as Intune can be used to remotely kick off the remote Windows Autopilot reset
* Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployment
	* Prerequisites
		* Windows 10, version 1903 or later or Windows 11
		* Windows Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions
		* An Intune Subscription
		* Physical devices that support TPM 2.0 and Device Attestation
		* Virtual machines are NOT supported
		* Physical devices with Ethernet connectivity
		* Wi-Fi is NOT supported
	* Preparation
		* User-driven Azure AD join - Ensure ability to deploy devices using Windows Autopilot and join them to an Azure AD tenant
		* User-driven with Hybrid Azure AD join - Ensure ability to deploy devices using Windows Autopilot and join them to an on-prem AD domain, register them with Azure AD to enable the Hybrid Azure AD join features
* Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployment
	* Scenarios
		* User-driven deployments with Azure AD join
		* User-driven deployments with Hybrid Azure AD join
	* Each of these have two parts
		* Technician Flow
		* User Flow
* Windows Autopilot for Pre-Provisioned Deployment
	* Technician Flow
		* Technician follows pre-provision process
			* Boot the device
			* From OOBE, press Windows key 5 times and choose the Windows Autopilot provisioning option
			* Validate information shown on screen
			* Make any necessary changes
			* Select Provision to begin the provisioning process
			* If green, select Reseal to finish and ship to user
			* If red, check to see what failed
	* User Flow
		* End User completes process
			* Power on
			* Select language, locale, and keyboard layout
			* Connect to network
			* Enter user's Azure AD credentials
			* If Hybrid Azure AD joined, after reboot, enter the user's Azure AD credentials again
			* Additional policies and apps will be applied at this point
* Windows Autopilot Deployment for Existing Devices
	* Prerequisites
		* Supported version of Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch
		* Windows ADK
		* Assigned Microsoft Intune Licenses
		* Azure AD Premium
		* A supported version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 imported into MECM as an OS image
