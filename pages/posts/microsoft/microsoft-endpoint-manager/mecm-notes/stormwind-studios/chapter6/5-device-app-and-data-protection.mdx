# Microsoft Endpoint Manager Notes
## Chapter 6.5 - Device, App, and Data Protection

### What is Conditional Access
* Common Signals
	* User or group membership
	* IP Information
	* Device
	* Application
	* Real-time and calculated risk detection
	* Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
* Common Decisions
	* Block Access
	* Grant Access
* Common Policies
	* Requiring multi-factor authentication for users with administrative roles
	* Requiring multi-factor authentication for Azure management tasks
	* Blocking sign-ins for users attempting to use legacy authentication protocols
	* Blocking risky sign-in behaviors
	* Requiring organization managed devices for specific applications
	* etc
* Identities
	* Require multi-factor authentication for admins*
	* Securing security info registration
	* Block legacy authentication*
	* Require multi-factor authentication for all users*
	* Require multi-factor authentication for guest access
	* Require multi-factor authentication for Azure management*
	* Require multi-factor authentication for risky sign-in **Requires Azure AD Premium P2**
	* Require password change for high-risk users **Requires Azure AD Premium P2**
* Devices
	* Require complaint or Hybrid Azure AD joined device for admins
	* Block access for unknown or unsupported device platform
	* No persistent browser session
	* Require approved client apps or app protection
	* Require compliant or Hybrid Azure AD joined device or multi-factor authentication for all users
	* Use application enforced restrictions for unmanaged devices
		* These four policies when configured together, provide similar functionality enabled by security defaults

### Building Conditional Access Policies
* All policies are enforced in two phases:
	* Phase 1 - Collect Session Details
	* Phase 2 - Enforcement
* Signal
	* User Location Device Application Real-Time Risk
* Decision
	* Allow Access Require MFA Block Access
* Enforcement
	* Apps and Data

### Conditional Access Assignments - Users and Groups
* Include Users
	* None
		* No users selected
	* All users
		* All users that exist in the directory including B2B guests
	* Select users and groups
		* All guest and external users
		* Directory roles
		* Users and Groups
* Exclude Users
	* All guest and external users
	* Directory roles
	* Users and groups
* Microsoft Cloud Applications
	* Administrators can assign a Conditional Access policy to cloud apps from Microsoft
* User Actions
	* User actions are tasks that can be performed by a user. Currently, Conditional Access supports two user actions:
		* Register security information:
		* Register or join devices

### Conditional Access Assignments - Conditions
* Signals
	* Signals can help more refined restrictions
		* Risk
		* Device Platform
		* Location
* Block Access
	* Block is a powerful control that should be wielded with appropriate knowledge
* Grant Access
	* Require multi-factor authentication (Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication)
	* Require device to be marked as compliant (Microsoft Intune)
	* Require hybrid Azure AD joined devices
	* Require approved client app
	* Require app protection policy
	* Require password change
	* Require all the selected controls (control AND control)
	* Require one of the selected controls (control OR control)
* Session
	* Application enforced restrictions
	* Conditional Access Application Control
	* Sign-in Frequency
	* Persistent Browser Session

### Conditional Access - Report-Only Mode
* Report-Only mode:
	* Conditional Access policies can be enabled in report-only mode, this is not applicable with the "User Actions" scope
	* During sign-in, policies in report-only mode are evaluated but not enforced
	* Results are logged in the **Conditional Access** and **Report-only** tabs of the Sign-in log details
	* Customers with an Azure Monitor subscription can monitor the impact of their Conditional Access policies using the Conditional Access insights workbook
	* Result:
		* Report-only: Success
			* All configured policy conditions, require non-interactive grant controls, and session controls were satisfied
		* Report-only: Failure
			* All configured policy conditions were satisfied but not all the required non-interactive grant controls or session controls were satisfied
		* Report-only: User action required
			* All configured policy conditions were satisfied but user action would be required to satisfy the required grant controls or session controls. With report-only mode, the user is not prompted to satisfy the require controls
		* Report-only: Not applied
			* Not all configured policy conditions were satisfied. For example, the user is excluded from the policy, or the policy only applies to certain trusted named locations
* Policy enforcement
	* Early-bound policy enforcement
	* Late-bound policy enforcement

### Conditional Access - Filter for Devices
* Common scenarios
	* Restrict access to Microsoft Azure Management, to privileged users, accessing from secure devices
		* You would create two Conditional Access policies:
			* Policy 1: All Global administrators - require MFA and require device compliance
			* Policy 2: All Global administrators excluding devices using rule expression device.extensionAttribute1 equals SAW and for Access controls

### Topic Summary
* Conditional Access
	* Assignments - Users and Groups
	* Cloud apps or actions
	* Access controls
	* Configure resilience defaults
	* Sign-in frequency and browser persistence controls
