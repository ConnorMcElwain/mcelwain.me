### Azure Resource Manager CheatSheet
**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** is a service that allows you to **manage** Azure resources.
It's a management layer that allows you to: Create, Update, Delete Resources
* Apply Management features e.g. Access Controls, Locks, Tags
* Writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via JSON templates

ARM is a service layer that **spans multiple features and services**: Subscriptions, Management Groups, Resource Groups, Resource Providers, Resource Locks, Azure Blueprints, Resource Tags, Access Control (IAM), Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), Azure Policies, ARM Templates.

Think of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) as a **gate keeper**.
* All **requests** flow through ARM and it decides whether that request can be performed on a **resource**

**Scope** is a **boundary of control** for azure resources. It's a way to **govern** your resource by placing resources within a logical grouping and also applying logical restrictions in the form of rules
* **Management Groups** - A logical grouping of multiple subscriptions
	* **Subscriptions** - Grants you access to Azure service based on a billing and support agreement
		* **Resource Groups** - A logical grouping of multiple resources
			* **Resources** - An azure service e.g. Azure VMs

An Azure Account can have **multiple subscriptions** and the most common three are: Free Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, Azure for Students. **Resource Providers** are a list of possible services within Azure, some services are registered by default and others need to be explicitly registered

**Resource Tags** are a **key and value pair** that you can assign to azure resources. Resource Locks prevent users from accidently modifying or deleting resources at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource Scope
* **CanNotDelete** (Delete) authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource
* **ReadOnly** (Read-only) authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource
**Blueprints** enable **quick creation** of **governed subscriptions**.
* Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Azure Blueprints can be accomplished with an ARM template
* Relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed)
