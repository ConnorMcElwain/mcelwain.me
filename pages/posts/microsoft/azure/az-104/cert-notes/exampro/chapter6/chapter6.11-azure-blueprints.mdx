# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 6.11 - Azure Blueprints

### Azure BluePrints
Azure BluePrints enable **quick creation** of **governed subscriptions**. Compose artifacts based on common or organization-based patterns into re-usable blueprints. The service is designed to help with environment setup.
* Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of carious resource templates and other artifacts such as:
	* Role Assignments
	* Policy Assignments
	* Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates)
	* Resource Groups
The Azure BluePrints service is backed by the globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB. Blueprint objects are replicated to multiple Azure regions.

* ARM Templates vs Azure Blueprints
	* Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Azure Blueprints can be accomplished with an ARM template
* ARM Template
	* ARM templates are storage either locally or in source control
	* There's no active connection or relationship to the ARM template
* Azure Blueprints
	* Relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed)
	* Can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the same blueprint

Azure BluePrints support improved tracking and auditing of deployments.
