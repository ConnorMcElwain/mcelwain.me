### Azure AD - Assign Access Rights
There are **four ways** to **assign resource access rights** to your users:
* Direct assignment
	* The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource
* Group assignment
	* The resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which automatically gives all of the group members access to the resource
* Rule-based assignment
	* The resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource
* External authority assignment
	* Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app
