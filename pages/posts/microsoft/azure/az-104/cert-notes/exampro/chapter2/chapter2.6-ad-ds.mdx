# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 2.6 - AD DS

### Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
In some cases you'll need to setup your own domain controller(s). When doing a life-and-shift from on-premise to Microsoft Azure and migrating Active Directory, Azure AD **does not support some domain services**.
* Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) provides **managed domain services** such as:
	* Domain joins
	* Group policies
	* Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)
	* Kerberos/NTLM authentication

You can use these domain services **without the need** to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud.
