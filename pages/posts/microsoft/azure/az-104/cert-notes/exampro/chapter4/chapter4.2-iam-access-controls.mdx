### Access Controls (IAM)
Identity Access Management (IAM) allows you to create and assign roles to users
* Azure Roles (RBAC system)
	* Roles restrict access to resource actions (also known as operations). There are two types of roles:
		* BuiltInRole - Managed Microsoft roles are read only pre-created roles for you to use
		* CustomRole - A role created by you with your own custom logic
* Role Assignment
	* Is when you apply a role to a:
		* Service principle
		* (User) group
		* User
* Deny Assignments
	* Block users from performing specific actions even if a role assignment grants them access. The only way to apply Deny assignments is through **Azure BluePrints**
