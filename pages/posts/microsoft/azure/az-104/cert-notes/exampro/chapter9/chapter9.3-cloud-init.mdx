## Chapter 9.3 - Cloud Init

### Cloud-Init
**Cloud-init** is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform **cloud instance initialization**. It's supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

What is Cloud Instance Initialization?
* The process of preparing an instance with configuration data for the operation system and runtime environment

Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:
* Meta-data
* User-data
* Vendor-data

**User Data** is a script that you want to run when an instance first boots up. eg: Install Apache web-server.

Azure Virtual Machines supports for cloud-init across most Linux Distros that support it.
