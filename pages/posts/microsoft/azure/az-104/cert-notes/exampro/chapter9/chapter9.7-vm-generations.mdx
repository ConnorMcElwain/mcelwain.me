# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.7 - VM Generations

### Hyper-V and Generation 1 vs 2
**Hyper-V** is Microsoft's **hardware virtualization product**. It lets you **create and run a software version of a computer**, called a virtual machine. Each virtual machine acts like a compete computer, running an operating system and programs.

There are two generations of Hyper-V VMs:
* **Generation 1** - Supports most guest operating systems
* **Generation 2** - Supports most 64-bit versions of Windows and more current versions of Linux and FreeBSD operating systems

**Azure** has Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs which are similar **but are not exactly the same** as Hyper-V Generations.

The most important difference between Azure Gen 1 and Gen 2:
* Gen 1
	* **BIOS-based** architecture
* Gen 2
	* **UEFI-based** boot architecture (improved boot and installation times)
	* Secure Boot verifies the boot loader is signed by a trusted authority
	* Large boot volume up to 64 TB

**Hyper-V VMs** are packaged into Virtual Hard Disk formats: VHD or VHDX files.
