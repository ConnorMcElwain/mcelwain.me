### Azure VMs - Sizes
Azure VMs come in a variety of sizes that are also optimized for specific use cases.
Azure VMs are grouped into:
* **Types:** General Purposes, Compute Optimized
* **Sizes:** B, Dsv3 (also called Series or SKU Family)

**General Purpose:** Balanced CPU-to-Memory ratio. Testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers.
**SKUs:** B, Dsv3, Dv3, Dasv4, Dav4, DSv2, Dv2, Av2, DC, DCv2, Dv4, Dsv4, Ddv4, Ddsv4

**Compute Optimized:** High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and app servers.
**SKUs:** F,Fs, Fsv2

**Memory Optimized:** High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics.
**SKUs:** Esv3, Ev3, Easv4, Eav4, Ev4, Esv4, Edv4, Edsv4, Edsv4, Mv2, M, DSv2, Dv2

**Storage Optimized:** High disk throughput and IO ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing and large transactional databases.
**SKUs:** Lsv2

**GPU:** Specialized VMs for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning.
**SKUs:** NC, NCv2, NCv3, NCasT4_v3 (Preview), ND, NDv2 (Preview), NV, NVv3, NVv4

**High Performance Compute:** Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA).
**SKUs:** HB, HBv2, HC, H

There are previous series of Virtual Machines sizes not shown here like Basic A
