## Chapter 9.8 - 3 Ways To Connect

### SSH, RDP, and Bastions
There are **3 ways to connect** to your Virtual Machines.
* **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a protocol to establish a secure connection between a client and a server
	* This is how you can remotely connect to your Azure VM via terminal
	* SSH happens on Port 22 via TCP
	* RSA Key Pairs are commonly used to authorize access
* **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection
	* This is how you can remotely connect to Windows Server via Visual Desktop
	* RDP happens on Port 3389 via TCP and UDP
* **Bastion**: Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure Portal. It provides **secure** and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure  Portal over TLS. A bastion is a hardened instance that is monitored. Users connect to this VM which then establishes a connection to the target instance. Sometimes known as jump box since you have one extra security step.
