# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.11 - Bastion

### Azure Bastion
**Azure Bastion** is an **intermediate harden instance** you can use to connect to your target server via SSH or RDP. It will provision a web-based RDP client or SSH Terminal.

**Some devices cannot run an RDP Client** such as a Google Chromebook, so Azure Bastion is one of the only ways to allow you to do that.

When you create an Azure Bastion you need to add a subnet to your VNet called **AzureBastionSubnet** with at least a size of /27 (32 addresses)

If you have a Windows Server which requires RDP, and have a Bastion in the same VNet, you just enter in your username and password like you normally would.

If you have a Linux server you can SSH with the Bastion. You can use SSH Private Key or Password that you set when you created your VM.
