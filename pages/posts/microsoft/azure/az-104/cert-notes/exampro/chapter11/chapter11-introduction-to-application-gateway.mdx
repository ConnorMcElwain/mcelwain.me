# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 11 - Introduction to Application Gateway

### Introduction to Application Gateway
**Azure Application Gateway** is **application-level routing** and **load balancing** service.

Application Gateway operates on **OSI Layer 7** also known as the Application Layer.

**Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)** policies can be attached to an Application Gateway to provide additional security.

You need to configure a **Frontend**
* **Private IP** will create an Internal Load Balancer
* **Public IP** will create a Public/External Load Balancer

You need to configure a **Backend**
* You'll need to create backend pools
	* A backend pool is a collection of resources to which your application gateway can send traffic
	* A backend pool can contain
		* Virtual machines
		* Virtual machine scale sets
		* IP addresses
		* Domain names
		* App services

You need to configure **Routing Rules**
* **Listeners** list to incoming traffic and passes it to rules
* **Rules** say who should we pass data to
* **HTTP/S settings** say how we should handle HTTP requests
