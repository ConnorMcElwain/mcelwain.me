## Chapter 10.5 - Disk Types

### Azure Disks - Disk Types
Azure offers **4 tiers** of disks:
1. **Ultra Disks**
	* Deliver high throughput, high I/OPS, and consistent low latency disk storage for Azure VMs
	* Dynamically change the performance of the disk, without the need to restart your VM
	* Suited for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads
	* Can only be used as **data disks** (use a Premium SSD or OS Disk)
	* Only supported with very specific VM series
2. **Premium SSD**
	* High-performance and low-latency disk support for Azure VMs with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads
	* Suitable for mission-critical production applications
	* Only be used with VM series that are premium storage-compatible
	* Guaranteed IOPS, and throughput of that disk (Standard tiers don't have IOPS guaranteed)
	* Designed to provide low single-digit millisecond latencies and target IOPS and throughput described in the preceding table 99.9% of the time
3. **Standard SSD**
	* Cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels
	* Compared to standard HDDs, standard SSDs deliver better availability, consistency, reliability, and latency
	* Suitable for Web Servers, low IOPS application servers, lightly used enterprise applications, and Dev/Test workloads
	* Designed to provide single-digit millisecond latencies and the IOPS and throughput up to the limits described in the preceding table 99% of the time
	* IOPS and throughput may vary sometimes depending on the traffic patterns
	* Available on all Azure VMs
4. Standard HDD
	* Reliable, low-cost disk support for VMs running latency-insensitive workloads
	* Available on all Azure VMs
	* Latency, IOPS, and Throughput of Standard HDD disks may vary more widely as compared to SSD-based disks
	* Designed to deliver write latencies under 10 ms and read latencies under 20 ms for most IO operations
	* Available in all Azure regions and can be used with all Azure VMs
