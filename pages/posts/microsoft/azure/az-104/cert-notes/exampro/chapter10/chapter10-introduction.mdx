# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10 - Introduction

### Introduction to Azure Disks
A virtual hard drive in the cloud **Block-level storage volumes** for SSD and HDD

**Azure Managed Disks** are **block-level storage volumes** that re managed by Azure and used with Azure VMs

Managed disks **are like a physical disk** in an on-premises server, but, virtualized. You specify **size**, **type**, and other **configurations** without worrying about the underlying hardware.
* Managed disks are designed for 99.999% availability
* Azure created **three replicas** of your data, allowing for high durability
* You can create up to 50,000 VM **disks** of a type in a subscription per region
* Allowing you to create up to 1,000 VMs in a virtual machine scale set using a Marketplace image
* Managed disks are integrated with **availability sets**
* Managed disks support **Availability Zones**
* **Azure Backup** can be used to create a backup job with time-based backups and backup retention policies
* You can use **Azure role-based access control** (RBAC) to assign specific permissions for a managed disk to one or more users
* You can **directly import** your Virtual Hard Drive Disks (VHD) into Azure Disks
* You can use **Azure Private Links** to ensure traffic between Azure Disks and VMs stay within the Microsoft network
