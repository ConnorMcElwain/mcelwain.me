## Chapter 10.7 - Azure Disks CheatSheet

### Azure Disks CheatSheet
* **Azure Managed Disks** are **block-level storage volumes** that are managed by Azure and used with Azure VMs
* Managed disks are designed for 99.999% availability
* Azure creates **three replicas** of your data, allowing for high durability
* You can create up to 50,000 VM **disks** of a type in a subscription per region
* Allowing you to create up to 1,000 VMs in a virtual machine scale set using a Marketplace image
* Managed disks are integrated with **availability sets**
* Managed disks support **Availability Zones**
* **Azure Backup** can be used to create a backup job with time-based backups and backup retention policies
* You can use **Azure role-based access control (RBAC)** to assign specific permissions for a managed disk to one or more users
* You can **directly import** your Virtual Hard Drive Disks (VHD) into Azure Disks
* You can use **Azure Private Links** to ensure traffic between Azure Disks and VMs stay within the Microsoft network
* **Azure Managed Disks** supports 2 types of encryption:
	* Server Side Encryption (SSE) enabled **by default** for all managed disks, snapshots, and images
		* Temporary disk are not encrypted by server-side encryption unless you enable encryption at host
		* Keys can be managed two ways:
			* Platform-managed keys - Azure manages your keys
			* Customer-managed keys - You manage your keys
	* Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) allows you to **encrypt the OS and Data** disks used by an IaaS Virtual Machine
	* For Windows encryption is done by **BitLocker**
	* For Linux encryption is done by **DM-Crypt**
* There are 3 main disk roles in Azure, the **data disk**, the **OS disk**, the **temporary disk**
* **Data Disk**
	* A managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep
	* Registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter that you choose
	* Has a maximum capacity of 32,767 gibibytes (GiB)
	* The size of the VM determines how many data disks you can attach and the type of storage you can use
* **OS Disk**
	* Every virtual machine has one attached operating system disk
	* That OS disk has a pre-installed OS, which was selected when the VM was created
	* This disk contains the boot volume
	* This disk has a maximum capacity of 4,095 GiB
* **Temporary Disk**
	* Most VMs contain a temporary disk, which is not a managed disk
	* Provides short-term storage for applications and processes, and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files
	* Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM
	* During a successful standard reboot of the VM, data on the temporary disk will persist
	* The temporary disk is typically `/dev/sdb` and on Linux and Windows VMs the temporary disk is `D:` by default
	* Not encrypted by SSE unless you enable encryption at host
* **A managed disk snapshot** is a **read-only crash-consistent full copy of a managed disk** that is stored as a standard managed disk by default
	* Snapshots are point in time recovery
	* Snapshots exist independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks
	* Snapshots  are billed based on the used size (if you have a 64 GB drive and only use 10 GB you're only billed the 10 GB)
	* You can see the used size of your snapshots by looking at the Azure Usage Report
* **A managed custom image** create an image (of your disk from your VM. Contains **all managed disks** associated with a VM, OS and data disks)
* A snapshot **doesn't have awareness of any disk except the one it contains**
* For a single disk use a **managed disk snapshot**, for multiple disks such as striping use a **managed custom disk**
* Azure offers **4 tiers** of disks: Ultra Disks, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, Standard HDD
1. **Ultra Disks** deliver high throughput, high IOPS, and consistent low latency disk storage for Azure VMs
	* Dynamically change the performance of the disk, without the need to restart your VM
	* Suited for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads
	* Can only be used as **data disks** (use a Premium SSD for OS Disk), only supported with very specific VM series
2. **Premium SSD** high-performance and low-latency disk supports for Azure VMs with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads
	* Suitable for mission-critical production applications
	* Only be used with VM series that are premium storage-compatible
	* Guaranteed IOPS, and throughput of that disk (Standard tiers don't have IOPS guarantees)
	* Designed to provide low single-digit ms latencies and target IOPS and throughput described in the preceding table 99.9% of the time
3. **Standard SSD** cost-effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels
	* Compare to standard HDDs, standard SSDs deliver better availability, consistency, reliability, and latency
	* Suitable for Web Servers, low IOPS application servers, lightly used enterprise applications, and Dev/Test workloads
	* Designed to provide single-digit ms latencies and the IOPS and throughput up to the limits described in the preceding table 99% of the time
	* IOPs and throughput may vary sometimes depending on the traffic patterns, available on all Azure VMs
4. **Standard HDD** reliable, low-cost disk support for VMs running latency-insensitive workloads
	* Available on all Azure VMs
	* Latency, IOPS, and throughput of Standard HDD disks may vary more widely as compared to SSD-based disks
	* Designed to delivery write latencies under 10 ms and read latencies under 20 ms for most IO operations
	* Available in all Azure regions and can be used with all Azure VMs
