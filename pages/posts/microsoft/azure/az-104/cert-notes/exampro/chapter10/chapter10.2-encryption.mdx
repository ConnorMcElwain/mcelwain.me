### Azure Disks - Encryption
**Azure Managed Disks** supports 2 types of encryption:
* Server Side Encryption (SSE)
* Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)

**Server Side Encryption (SSE)**
Provides encryption-at-rest and safeguards your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. Enable **by default** for all managed disks, snapshots, and images. Temporary disk are not encrypted by server-side encryption unless you enable encryption at host

Keys can be managed two ways:
1. Platform-managed keys - Azure manages your keys
2. Customers-managed keys - You managed your keys

**Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)**
Allows you to **encrypt the OS and Data** disks used by an IaaS Virtual Machine.
* For Windows encryption is done by **BitLocker**
* For Linux encryption is done by **DM-Crypt**
