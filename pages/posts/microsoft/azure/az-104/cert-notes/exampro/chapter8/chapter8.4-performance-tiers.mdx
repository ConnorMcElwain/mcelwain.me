## Chapter 8.4 - Performance Tiers

### Performance Tiers (Blob Storage)
There are 2 types of performance tiers for storage accounts: Standard and Premium. **IOPS** stands 
for Input/Output Operations Per Second. The higher the IOPS the faster a drive can read and write.
* Premium Performance
	* Stored on Solid State Drives **(SSDs)**
	* Optimize for low-latency
	* Higher throughput
	* Use cases:
		* Interactive workloads
		* Analytics
		* AI or ML
		* Data transformation
An SSD has **no moving parts** and data is distributed randomly. This is why it can read and write so fast.

* Standard Performance
	* Stored on Hard Disk Drives **(HDDs)**
	* Varied performance based on access tier (Hot, Cool, Archive)
	* Use cases:
		* Backup and disaster recovery
		* Media content
		* Bulk data processing
A HDD **has moving parts**, an arm that needs to read and write data sequential to a disk. It's very good at writing or reading large amounts of data that is close together.
