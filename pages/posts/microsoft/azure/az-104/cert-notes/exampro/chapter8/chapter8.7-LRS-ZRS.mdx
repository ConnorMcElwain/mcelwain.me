## Chapter 8.7 - LRS ZRS

### Replication and Data Redundancy
* Redundancy in the Primary Region
	* Data is replicated **3 times** in the primary region
	* There are **two options** for storing in the primary region

* Locally Redundant Storage **(LRS)**
	* Copies data synchronously in primary region
	* 99.99% (11 nines) durability
	* **Cheapest option**
* Zone-redundant storage **(ZRS)**
	* Copies data synchronously **across 3 AZs** in a primary region
	* 99.99% (12 nines) durability

### Practice Quiz
* Using the Redundancy in the Primary Region Tier, data is replicated 3 times in the primary region.
	* **True**
	* False

* What is Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)?
	* It copies data synchronously in primary region, it has 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability and is the cheapest option.
* Which option for storing in the primary region copies data synchronously across 3 AZs and it has 99.9999999999% (12 nines)Â durability?
	* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
