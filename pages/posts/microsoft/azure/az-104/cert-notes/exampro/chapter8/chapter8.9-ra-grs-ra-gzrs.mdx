# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.9 - RA-GRS RA-GZRS

### Replication and Data Redundancy
Redundancy in the Secondary Region with Read Access
* Data is replicate synchronously to primary region
* Your data will be "in-sync" with your primary and you'll have **read access**

* Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
	* Copies data synchronously in primary region
	* Copies data synchronously to another region
	* 99.99% (16 nines) of durability
* Read-Access Geo-Zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)
	* Copies data synchronously across 3 AZs in a physical region
	* Copies data synchronously to another region
	* 99.99% (16 nines) of durability

### Practice Quiz
* The **Redundancy in the Secondary Region with Read Access** Tier allows your data to be “in-sync” with your primary and you’ll have read access.
	* False
	* **True**
* Which storage tier copies data **synchronously** **across 3 AZs** in a physical region, copies data **synchronously** to another region, and 99.99999999999999% (16 9’s) of durability?
	* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
	* Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
	* **Read-Access Geo-Zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)**
	* Geo-Zone-redundant storage (GZRS)

* Which replication type copies data **synchronously** in the primary region, copies data **synchronously** to another region, and has 99.99999999999999% (16 9’s) of durability?
	* Read-Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
