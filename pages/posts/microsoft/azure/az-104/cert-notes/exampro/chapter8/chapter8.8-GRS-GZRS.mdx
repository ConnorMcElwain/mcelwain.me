## Chapter 8.8 - GRS GZRS

### Replication and Data Redundancy
* Redundancy in the Secondary Region
	* Replicate to a secondary region in case of primary regional disaster
	* The secondary region is determined based on your primary's pair region
	* Secondary region isn't available for read or write access (except in event of failover)

* Geo Redundant Storage **(GRS)**
	* Copies data synchronously in primary region
	* Copies data asynchronously to another region
	* 99.99% (16 nines) of durability
* Geo-Zone-redundant storage **(GZRS)**
	* Copies data synchronously **across 3 AZs** in a physical region
	* Copies data asynchronously to another region
	* 99.99 (16 nines) of durability

### Practice Quiz
* Which storage tier copies data **synchronously** across **3 AZs** in a physical region, copies data asynchronously to another region, and has 99.99999999999999% (16 9’s) of durability?
	* Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
	* **Geo-Zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**
	* Geo Redundant Storage (GRS)
	* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)

* What is Geo-Zone-redundant storage (GZRS)?
	* A storage tier that copies data synchronously across **3 AZs** in a physical region, copies data asynchronously to another region, and has 99.99999999999999% (16 9’s) of durability.
