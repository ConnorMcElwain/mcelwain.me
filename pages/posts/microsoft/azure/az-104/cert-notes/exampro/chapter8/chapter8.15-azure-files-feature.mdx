## Chapter 8.15 - Azure Files Feature

### Azure Files
* Backups
	* You can backup your file share with **shared snapshots**
		* They are read-only
		* Incremental (they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot)
		* You can have up to **200 snapshots** per file share
		* You can retain backups for **up to 10 years**
		* Backups are stored within your file share (if you delete your file share you will delete your backups)
* Soft Delete
	* You can prevent accidently deletion by turning on Soft Delete (Storage will be marked for deletion and retained for a period of time before final delete occurs)
* Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
	* An additional layer of security intelligence that provides alerts when it detects anomalous activity on your storage account
* Store Tiers:
	* **Premium** - Store on to SSD with single-digit milliseconds for most IO operations
	* **Transaction optimized** - Store on HDD with transaction heavy workloads that don't need the latency offered by premium file shares (historically this tier has been called **standard**)
	* **Hot** - Optimized for general purpose file sharing scenarios such as **team shares** and **Azure File Sync**
	* **Cool** - Stored on HDD for cost-efficient storage optimized for online archive storage scenario

* Types of Storage
	* **General purpose version 2 (GPv2)** - Deployed on to HDD
	* **FileStorage** - Deployed onto SSD
* Identity
	* **On-Premise** - Azure Storage can be joined to an on-premise Active Directory Domain Service
	* **Managed** - Azure Storage can be joined to Microsoft managed Active Directory Domain Service
	* **Store Account Key** - A username (storage account name) and password (account key) can be used to mount
* Networking
	* Azure Files are accessible inside or outside your AWS Account from anywhere via storage account **public endpoint**
	* SMB connects to **port 445**, your organization may need to unblock this port so you can mount your file share
* Encryption
	* Azure Files is **encrypted-at-rest** using Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE)
	* Azure Files is **encrypted-in-transit** with SMB 3.0+ with encryption or HTTPS
