# AZ-104 Stormwind Studio Certification Course Notes
## Day 3.1 - Azure Object Hierarchy - Physical

### Topic: Azure Objects
* Azure Object Hierarchy (Physical)
* Azure Object Hierarchy (Logical, Administrative)
* Budgeting and Cost Management
* Resource Tagging

### Azure Object Hierarchy: Physical
* Regions
* Availability Zones
* Region Pairs

### Azure Object Hierarchy: Physical - Regions
* **A region** is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network
* Regions, Products, and Services Operate within a Region and certain technologies can be strategically architected to span regions

### Azure Object Hierarchy: Physical - Availability Zones
* **Availability Zones** - physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
* Each datacenter within an Availability zone has independent:
	* Power
	* Cooling
	* Networking
* Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks
* Example:
	* Azure Region
		* Availability Zone 1
		* Availability Zone 2
		* Availability Zone 3
* **Availability zones provide**
* **High Availability**
* **Low Latency**
* **Primarily used for:**
	* VMs, Managed Disks, Load Balancers, SQL Databases and Azure Services the Support Availability Zones
* There are currently 3 main categories for Availability Zone Utilization
	* **Zonal services:**
		* You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses)
	* **Zone-redundant services:**
		* The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database)
	* **Non-regional services:**
		* Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages, such as Entra ID

### Azure Object Hierarchy: Physical - Region Pairs
* Region pairs
	* Where available Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) **at least 300 miles away**
	* Provide Disaster resistant High Availability
	* Replication across Region Pairs is not automatic
