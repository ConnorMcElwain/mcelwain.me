### Entra ID Roles
* **Purpose:** Entra ID roles control access to Microsoft Entra resources, including **users, groups**, and **applications**, using the **Microsoft Graph API**
* **Scope:** It manages access to resources within the Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) environment
* **How it works:**
	* Entra ID roles are used for managing resources like users, groups, and applications at the tenant level
	* These roles are not tied to specific Azure resources but focus on identity and access management within the Entra environment
* **Example:** You can assign a user the SharePoint Administrator role which will allow them to manage all aspects of SharePoint Online for tenancy
