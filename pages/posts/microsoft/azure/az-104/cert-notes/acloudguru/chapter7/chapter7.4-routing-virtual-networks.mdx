# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.4 - Routing Virtual Networks

### Describing Routing
* Routes = Paths for Connectivity
	* Routes are paths through which traffic can flow
	* For example, a route allowing virtual machines to communicate with internet outbound

### Routing Types
* System Routes
	* **Default routes** built-in to virtual networks that **cannot** be modified
* Custom Routes
	* **User-defined routes** or borer gateway protocol (BGP) routes that **override system routes**

### Routing Scenarios
* User-Defined Route
	* Routes created by users that take precedence over all routes
	* For example, overriding routes to the internet to either go to nothing or go to a network virtual appliance (NVA) like Azure Firewall
* BGP Route
	* Routes that are exchanged between integrated networks
	* For example, hybrid networks or VNet peering scenarios

### Key Takeaways
* System Routes
	* **Default routes** built-in to virtual networks that **cannot** be modified
* Custom Routes
	* **User-defined routes** or BGP routes that **override system routes**
* **Custom > BGP > System**
