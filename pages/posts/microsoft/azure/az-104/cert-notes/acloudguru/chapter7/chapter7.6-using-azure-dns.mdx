	* Implemented using:
		* Records/record sets
		* Support A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, PTR, SRV, and SOA

* Record
	* Name
		* www.acg.com
	* Type
		* A
	* Value
		* Public_IP
* Record Set
	* The main concept behind the record set is that we're providing multiple records in a set, rather than individual records:
	* Name
		* www.acg.com
		* www.acg.com
	* Type
		* A
		* A
	* Value
		* Public_IP_1
		* Public_IP_2

### Describing Alias Records
* Alias Record
	* Reference the resource rather than the IP address that may change over time:
	* Name
		* www.acg.com
	* Type
		* A
	* Value
		* Resource

### Key Takeaways
