# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.8 - Using Service Endpoints

### Accessing PaaS Services
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) Connectivity
	* By default, Microsoft services have a public endpoint
	* For example, a VM will access an Azure file share from a storage account using a public endpoint

### Describing Service Endpoints
* Service Endpoint
	* Using service endpoints, you can provide private connectivity to a service from inside your virtual network
	* For example, a VM will access an Azure file share from a storage account using a service endpoint
	* Enabled *per* subnet
	* **Not** all services are supported
	* Supported services differ per region
	* Does **not** give services a private IP
	* Provides source IP as private IP
	* Firewalls can enhance security (optional)

### Key Takeaways
* Service Endpoint
	* Using service endpoints, you can enable private connectivity to your services
	* Decreased attack surface
	* Enables use of NSG rules
	* Enhanced routing
