# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 11 - Creating an App Service Plan

### What Is an App Service Plan?
* App Service Plan
	* An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run on
* Pricing Tier
	* Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, and Isolated
* Size of VMs
	* The size of virtual machine instances (Small, Medium, Large)
* Number of VMs
	* The number of virtual machine instances running under a plan
* Region
	* Azure geolocation where app is deployed (e.g. East US, West US, South Central US, etc.)

### App Service Plan Compute Types
The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines the features you get and what you pay. There are three core compute types across the plans.
* Shared
	* Run apps on the same VM as other apps, including apps of other customers. (Cannot scale out because of shared compute)
* Dedicated
	* Run only apps using the same App Service Plan on a dedicated VM. (Isolated compute)
* Isolated
	* Run apps using dedicated VMs and dedicated VNets. (Isolated compute and networking)

### Traditional vs. App Service
* Traditional
	* Administer and manage hardware
	* Manage patching and security
	* Manage load balancing
* App Service
	* Managed infrastructure
	* High availability
	* Scalability

### Exam Tips
* App Service Plans
	* A plan that defines the compute resources and available features for a web app
* App Services Plan Compute Resources
	* Pricing tier, size of VM instances, number of VM instances, and region
* App Services Plan Compute Types
	* Shared, dedicated, and isolated. Each provides a different level of compute isolated, network isolation, and features like scaling
* App Services Plans and Web Apps
	* Provides a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to configure and host applications, rather than managing infrastructure. You just manage a few configuration details and your code
