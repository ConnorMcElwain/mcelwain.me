# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 1.2 - AZ-104 Readiness Quiz

### Question 1
Choose 4
* What are some of the advantages of using a subnet with Azure Virtual Network?
	* **Subnets can have network security groups associated with them in the Resource Manager deployment model for more granular control.**
	* **You can secure a subnet individually from the entire virtual network.**
	* **IP address allocation on the subnet is more efficient.**
	* **You can logically group services on the same virtual network.**
	* Virtual machines will start faster, as the network provisioning is already done.
	* You can save costs by only using a part of the virtual network through a subnet.

You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol. Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more subnetworks. Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more subnetworks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. This makes address allocation more efficient. You can have a separate network security group for the subnet, and you can logically group services as well. Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more subnetworks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. This allows you to logically group services in subnets on the same virtual network.
