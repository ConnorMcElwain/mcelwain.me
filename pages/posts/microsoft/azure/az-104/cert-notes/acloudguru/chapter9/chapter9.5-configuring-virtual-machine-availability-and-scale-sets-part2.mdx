# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9.5 - Configuring Virtual Machine Availability and Scale Sets (Part 2)

### Why Use Scale Sets?
* Purpose of Virtual Machine Scale Sets
	* Simplify scaling configurations
	* Save costs by aligning usage with demand
	* Scale to meet demand of traffic

### Virtual Machine Scale Set Components
* Scale Set Components
	* VM Definition
		* Define VM size, OS, NICs, storage, etc.
	* Autoscaling Definition
		* Define scaling actions, scaling in/out based on condition met (e.g. If CPU utilization > 80% then +1 VM)
	* Scale-In Policy
		* Delete VMs by priority as scaling-in-operations occur

### Exam Tips
* High Availability
	* Design highly available solutions using zonal redundant deployments
* Availability Sets
	* Provide protection for redundant VMs by preventing outages related to faults and updates by logically grouping them into domains
* Scale Sets
	* Auto scale solutions to meet demands of traffic and scale in to decrease costs when demand goes down
