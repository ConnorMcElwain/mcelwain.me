# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 9 - Creating and Managing Virtual Machines (Part 1)

### What is an Azure Virtual Machine?
* Scalable cloud computing resource offered as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Includes CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources
* Can be created from the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell

### Defining Virtual Machines
* Core Parts
	* CPU and Memory
		* Determined by virtual machine (VM) sizing. Selected based on VM use case
	* Networking
		* Virtual Networks (VNets), Subnets, Network Interface Card (NIC), Public IP (PIP), and Network Security Group (NSG)
	* Storage
		* Azure Disks, consisting of OS disk, temporary disk, and data disk

### Keeping VM Workloads in the Family
* VM Family Type:
	* General Purpose
		* **Balanced CPU-to-memory.** Best for testing, development, or for small to medium workloads
	* Compute Optimized
		* **High CPU-to-memory.** Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processing, and app servers
	* Memory Optimized
		* **High memory-to-CPU.** Works well for relational databases, caching, and in-memory analytics
	* Storage Optimized
		* **High disk throughput and I/O.** Good for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL, and data warehousing. Works well for Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) databases
	* GPU
		* **Specialized for heavy graphic rendering and video editing.** Works well for artificial intelligence (AI) training and deep learning
	* HPC
		* **Fastest and most powerful.** Great for intensive workloads like large scale geophysics and advanced mathematics/sciences
