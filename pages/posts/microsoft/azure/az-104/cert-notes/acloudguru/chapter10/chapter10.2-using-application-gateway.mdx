# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10.2 - Using Application Gateway

### Describe Azure Application Gateway
* Azure Application Gateway (App GW)
	* Azure Application Gateway is a networking service for load balancing between backend compute
		* Layer 7 load balancing (HTTP/HTTPS)
		* URL path-based routing
		* Backend resources must be redundant
		* Virtual machines, VMSS, App Services

### Components of an Application Gateway
* Frontend IP
	* Private or public endpoint for accessing the load balancing solution
* Backend Pool
	* Compute solution underlying the load balancer
* Listener
	* Port, protocol, and certificate configurations
* Rules
	* Load balancing rules, HTTP settings, and health probe

### Key Takeaways
* Load Balancing
	* Balance traffic between backend pools using HTTP/HTTPS
* SSL Termination
	* Terminate TLS/SSL at the application gateway
* URL Routing
	* URL path-based routing between multiple backend pools
* Security
	* Web Application Firewall security for the load balancing solution
* Autoscaling
	* Scale up/down the backend pools for the application gateway
