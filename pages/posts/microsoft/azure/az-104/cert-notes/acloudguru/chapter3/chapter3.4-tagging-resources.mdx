# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 3.4 - Tagging Resources

### Describing Resource Tagging
* What Are Tags?
	* Tags inside of Azure are simple just a name-value pair
		* Name:Value
			* Dept:Marketing
			* Env:Prod
	* Name can be 512 characters, and value can be 256 characters
	* Storage accounts can have a name with only 128 characters

### Resource Tag Assignment Hierarchy
* Tags are not inherited
	* You can create Azure Policies and create a policy that forced this inheritance of these tags for things inside of resource groups for example
* A resource can have up to 50 tags

### Key Takeaways
* Manage resources via tags. For example, shutting down all VMs with a specific tag or developers can only update VMs with a specific tag
* Tags are not inherited from the higher scope like a resource group. Each resource must be tagged independently. You can use Azure Policy to enforce tagging
