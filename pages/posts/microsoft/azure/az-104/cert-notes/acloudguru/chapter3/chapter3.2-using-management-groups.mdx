### Defining Management Groups
* Managing Subscriptions
	* Organize and manage subscriptions by logically grouping them into management groups
	* Organizational hierarchy
	* Provides another scope for enforcing governance and compliance
* Parent-Child Relationships
	* Root management group is the top-level
	* Management groups and subscriptions can have a single parent
	* Supports six levels of hierarchy
* Compliance Support
	* Azure Policies
	* Azure role-based access control (RBAC)

### Understanding Hierarchy
The root management group is the top-level resource. It's the parent or grandparent or great grandparent of everything that will fall underneath it, all the way down to 6 levels of hierarchy.

### Key Takeaways
We use management groups to provide a set of hierarchal structure for organizations. For example, you have a root management group. And underneath the root management group, we may have subscriptions in other management groups. These are child objects of the root management group. This can continue down 6 levels of hierarchy. For the root management group, it's important that we understand that we are not given access to this by default.
* Root management group access is not given by default
	* This is due to the type of access this would give an individual. This would provide access to do things throughout your entire environment.
* Root management group cannot be moved or deleted
* Azure RBAC is supported for management groups
* Global Administrators must be elevated to User Access Administrator of root group
