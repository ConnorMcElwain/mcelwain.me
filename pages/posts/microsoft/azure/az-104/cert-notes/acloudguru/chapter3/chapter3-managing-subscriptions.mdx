## Chapter 3 - Managing Subscriptions

### Describing Subscriptions
* Billing unit that aggregates all costs of underlying resources
* Contain resource groups and their associated resources
* Scoping level for governance and security
Subscriptions are the billing unit that we used to have an understanding of our cloud costs. The cloud cost is generated by those underlying resources inside of our subscriptions. The types of resources that we have in our subscriptions are resource groups and those resources that they contain, such as virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts.

### Types of Subscriptions
These are just a few subscription examples:
* Azure Plan
* Enterprise Agreement Support
* Pay-As-You-Go
* Free Trial

### Subscription Naming Conventions
* Prod/Dev/Staging
	* Subscriptions are named based on whether they are production, development, or staging environments
* Department/Teams
	* Subscriptions are named based on the department or team the subscription is intended for so that billing can then be easily associated with a given business unit
* Region
	* Subscriptions are named based on the region of the business that uses the subscription
