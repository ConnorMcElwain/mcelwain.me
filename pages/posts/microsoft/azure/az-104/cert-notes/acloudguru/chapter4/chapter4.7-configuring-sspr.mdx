## Chapter 4.7 - Configuring SSPR

### Describing SSPR
* Old School Password Reset Method
	* Whenever a user would have a password authentication issue, it would require an administrator to reset their passwords
		* Less productive workers
		* Increased admin overhead
* Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
	* Users can reset their passwords by themselves without having to actually make this request to the help desk admin.
		* Enable users to change or reset their passwords
		* Increased productivity
		* Decreased admin overhead

### SSPR Process

### Authentication Methods
* Mobile Apps
	* Authentication via app notification. An example is the Microsoft Authenticator application

	* Authentication via time-based codes. An example is the Microsoft Authentication application
* Email
	* Authentication via an email external to Microsoft using codes sent to that email address
* Mobile Phone
	* Authentication via a mobile number using a phone call or SMS that provides a code. (Less recommended method)
* Office Phone
	* Authentication via a non-mobile phone using a phone call that prompts the user to press #
* Security Questions
	* Authentication via answering a set of security questions. (Least recommended method)

### SSPR Considerations
* Keep In Mind...

	* Required Licenses
		* Azure AD P1 or P2, Microsoft Apps for Business, or Microsoft 365 licensing is required for SSPR

### Key Takeaways
* Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
	* Unauthenticated users use SSPR
