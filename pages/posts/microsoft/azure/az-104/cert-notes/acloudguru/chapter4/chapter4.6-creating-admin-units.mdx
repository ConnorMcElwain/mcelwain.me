## Chapter 4.6 - Creating Administrative Units

### Describing Administrative Units
Lets say we have an Azure Active Directory for this example, and this is our tenant, our instance of the Azure Active Directory service. We're going to have our identity objects inside of this. This will consist of our users, applications, devices, and our groups inside of this tenant. We can have other non traditional identity objects like members. We're going to have administrators. These administrators are just members of our Azure Active Directory tenant with Azure AD administrative roles. These administrators in this example have the privileges to do everything at the tenant level, but we don't always want that. The reason why this can be undesirable is, for example, if they have this privilege at the tenant level, then each of these admins will be able to perform their admin functionality on all users inside of the tenant. That isn't always what we want to happen. Administrative units can solve this issue. Administrative units allow us to create this logical container, inside of the flat file structure that is Azure Active Directory. A good example would be creating administrative units to split up USA-based users and Canadian users.
