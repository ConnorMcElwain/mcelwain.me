It's important to keep in mind that Azure AD is our service for identity and access management, and this includes, users and managing roles that are assigned to those users and the permissions that come with those roles, but also it includes things like having these identity resources such as our users and our groups, and managing device identities, and how we can join devices into our network, and enforce compliance for our identity and access management in the Azure cloud.
