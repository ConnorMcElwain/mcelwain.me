## Chapter 8 - Configuring Azure VNet Peering

### Describing VNet Peering
* Network Connectivity
	* Default Connectivity
		* While intra-network traffic and outbound internet traffic is allowed, virtual networks are by default isolated
	* VNet Peering
		* Bridge together virtual networks to allow connectivity between these networks
* Non-Reciprocal
	* Connection must be established in both directions
* Global Connectivity
	* Peerings can be same region or cross-region (global)
Something we have to keep in mind with VNet peerings is that they are non-transitive. Say we have a peering connection between VNet-1 and VNet-2, and the one going in the opposite direction to VNet-2 to VNet-1, these virtual networks are peered. Then let's say that VNet-2 is also in a peering relationship with VNet-3 here. And this peering connection allows VNet-2 and VNet-3 to communicate. Just because VNet-2 is able to communicate with VNet-1 and VNet-3, does not mean that VNet-1 and VNet-3 can communicate. Virtual network peerings are non-transitive. We would have to create a separate peering connection between VNet-1 and VNet-3, and we'd have to have that peering connection in order for them to communicate going in both directions.

### Benefits of VNet Peering
* Benefits
	* Low-latency, high-bandwidth connections
	* Cross-network communications
	* Data transfer between/across:
		* Subscriptions
		* AAD tenants via Azure roles
		* Azure regions

### Key Takeaways
* Types of Peering
	* Virtual network peering
	* Global virtual network peering
* Benefits
	* Low-latency, high-bandwidth connections
	* Cross-network communications
	* Data transfer between/across subscriptions, AAD tenants via Azure roles, and Azure regions
* Transitivity
	* Peering connections are non-transitive
* Reciprocity
	* Peering connections are not reciprocal
