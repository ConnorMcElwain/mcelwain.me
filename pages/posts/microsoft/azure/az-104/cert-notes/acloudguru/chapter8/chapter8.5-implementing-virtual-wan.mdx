## Chapter 8.5 - Implementing Virtual WAN

### Describing Virtual WAN
This is considered a networking service that allows us a single, operational interface to be able to manage a hub-and-spoke style network and fully mesh networks inside of the Azure cloud. With a virtual WAN, we can use virtual WAN hubs to create hub-and-spoke style networks, where we do things like have our VPN connections for our Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site for both our on-prem and remote users. We can also connect our ExpressRoute on-prem connections, as well as make connections to our virtual networks inside of these hubs. And with this WAN, we have a single operational interface to manage all of these connections, to create this hub-and-spoke network. We also have the ability to manage things like our firewalls and our routes, so that we can manage our entire networks topology and the capabilities those connections, the routing, and the security through the firewall, all through that single operational interface. What we're really creating inside of these WANs are hubs. We can create a single virtual hub that's a managed virtual network in each region. This allows us to create connectivity between regions that are also managing their own connections via VPNs for Point-to-Site, Site-to-Site, ExpressRoute, and virtual network connections, and create a full meshed network for everything that we have going on inside of our organization's network.
