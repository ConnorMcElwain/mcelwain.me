# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 6 - Understanding Storage Accounts

### Describing Storage Accounts
* Storage Account
	* Top-level resource for storage purposes inside of Azure
	* Underneath the storage account you have multiple different subservices that provide varying storage options
		* Azure Queue
			* Message-based storage for microservices
		* Azure Files
			* Cloud-based file-sharing service
		* Azure Table
			* Non-relational, semi-structured data storage service
		* Azure Blob
			* Object-oriented storage solution

### Components of Storage Accounts
* Account Type
	* Determines features and costs
* Performance Tier
	* Determines performance levels
* Replication
	* Determines infrastructure redundancy
* Access Tier
	* Determines access levels and data costs

### Understanding Azure Storage Redundancy
* Region
	* 2-millisecond latency envelopes
	* Inside of these regions we have 1 or more availability zones
		* Inside of each of these availability zones, we have independent power, cooling, and network
		* Each availability zone typically has 1 or more datacenters
* Locally redundant storage (LRS)
	* Storage all 3 copies of data inside the same availability zone
		* If this availability zone were to go down, we would lose this data
* Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
	* Has a copy of our data in each availability zone within a region
		* This can withstand 2 availability zone failures before you lose data
* Geo redundant storage (GRS)
	* Has 3 copies of our data in an availability zone in two different regions
		* 3 copies of data in a single availability zone per region (a total of 2 regions) so 6 copies within 2 availability zones in 2 regions
* Geo-zonal redundant storage (GZRS)
	* This option can provide us the ability to store a single copy of our data in each availability zone in the home region, and then store 3 copies of our data inside of an availability zone in a secondary region
* Read-access geo-zonal redundant storage (RA-GZRS)
	* The same as GZRS, but it's read-access

### Key Takeaways
* Account Type
	* General purpose v1
		* Legacy for blobs, files, queues, and tables
	* General purpose v2
		* Recommended for blobs, files, queues, and tables
* Performance Tier
	* Blob storage
		* Legacy blob-specific accounts
	* Standard
		* Default storage performance tier
	* Premium
		* High-performance storage tier
* Replication
	* Locally redundant storage (LRS)
		* Three copies in a physical location within a region
	* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
		* Three copies across zones within a region
	* Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
		* LRS in a primary and secondary region
	* Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
		* ZRS in a primary region and LRS in a secondary region
* Access Tier
	* Hot
		* Frequently accessed data
	* Cold
		* Infrequently accessed data
	* Archive
		* Backup data rarely accessed
