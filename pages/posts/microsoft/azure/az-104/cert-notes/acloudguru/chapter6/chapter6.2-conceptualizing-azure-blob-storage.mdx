# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 6.2 - Conceptualizing Azure Blob Storage

### Describing Azure Blob Storage
* Blob Storage
	* Azure Blob is a sub-service or sub-resource of Azure Storage (storage accounts)
	* Blob storage is **object based** and easily accessible from HTTP/REST
	* Store items such as:
		* Image and video files
		* Text files
		* Log files
		* VHD (virtual hard disk) files
	* All of these things store inside of our Azure Blob Storage, inside of a container, which acts like a bucket. And inside of this we have a virtualization prefix that allows it to appear as though it's a file system, but it's actually a flat file structure

### Components of Blob Architecture
* Blob Service
	* A sub-service for storage accounts
* Blob Container
	* The container where we storage our blobs
* Blobs
	* The data we storage in our containers

### Types of Blobs
* Block Blobs
	* Storing images or videos. Best suited for streaming
* Append Blobs
	* Log files
* Page Blobs
	* Virtual machine disks

### Container Access Levels
* Access Control
	* By default, public access to blobs is granted at the storage account level
* Container Access Levels
	* **Private** (no anonymous access)
	* **Blob** (anonymous access to blob)
	* **Container** (anonymous access to container and blobs it contains)

### Key Takeaways
* Azure Blob services are:
	* Object-based Storage solution
* Blob Containers
* Flat-File Structure
	* Like a "bucket" that has the appearance of an actual file system
