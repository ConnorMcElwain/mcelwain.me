# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 6.3 - Configuring Blob Object Replication

### Describing Object Replication
* Object Replication
	* Object replication asynchronously copies block blobs between storage accounts
		* Requires source and destination storage accounts
		* Requires versioning and change feed
		* Supports cross-tenant replication

### Benefits of Object Replication
* Minimized Latency
	* Reducing latency for read requests
* Increased Efficiency
	* Processing block blobs in different regions
* Data Distribution
	* Processing and analyzing data in one location that replicates to other regions
* Cost Optimization
	* Moving replicated data to the archive tier can reduce costs

### Key Takeaways
* Versioning
	* Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination accounts to perform replication
* Cross Subscription and Azure AD
	* Object replication is supported across subscriptions and Azure AD tenants
* Change Feed
	* Change feed must be enabled on the source account. Azure Storage monitors the $blobchangefeed to advise replication
* Replication Policy
	* A storage account can be a source for up to two destination accounts. Each policy supports only a single pairing using a policy ID
