## Chapter 11.10 - Privacy, Compliance and Trust Quiz

### Question 1
* What type of lock in Azure prevents any changes to the resources?
	* **Read-only**
	* Create-only
	* Closed
	* Write

A read-only lock on a resource means you can't make any changes to the resources. It is one of the two types of locks in Azure.

### Question 2
* What are the primary functions of role-based access control in Azure?
	* It provides multi-factor authentication.
	* **It allows defining which users have access to specific Azure resources and what actions they can take on those resources.**
	* It offers tiered privacy protection for users within your Azure tenant.
	* It limits user management to five predefined roles for simplicity.

Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to. You have very detailed control of resource actions, and you assign roles to users to let them take those actions. You can define as many roles as you wish in RBAC.

### Question 3
* Which services can feed data into Azure Monitor?
	* Only Azure services that are available on a premium subscription
	* **Both Azure services and on-premises services**
	* All services that are hosted on Azure itself
	* Only on-premises services that connect to an Azure service

Azure Monitor can accept data from almost any service, in order to monitor their operation and health. You get a single dashboard to view all of the current metrics, or you can delve into the archived data through the interactive query language.

### Question 4
* What is NOT a characteristic of the Azure China region?
	* **You have to be a Chinese citizen to use the China region.**
	* All customer data is guaranteed to be geographically within China.
	* All Azure services available in the China region are physically located inside China.
	* You are guaranteed to be compliant with all Chinese data and IT regulations.

The Chinese region can be used by non-Chinese users and organizations, as long as they have a business presence in China.

### Question 5
* Which companies must comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements?
	* Only companies that are headquartered within the European Union must adhere to GDPR.
	* **Companies that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents no matter where they or their enterprise are located.**
	* Any company in the world that has an online presence must adhere to GDPR.
	* Only companies in Europe must adhere to GDPR.

Any company that wishes to interact with people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents no matter where they or their enterprise are located, must adhere to the many GDPR rules around privacy. The Microsoft Trust Center has more information on how to do this within Azure.

### Question 6
* What is a key feature of role-based access control in Azure?
	* It only allows the use of five predefined roles for user management.
	* It provides tiered privacy protection for users within your Azure tenant.
	* **Defining which users have access to specific Azure resources.**
	* It inherently includes multi-factor authentication.

Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources. You assign roles to users to let them access specific resources. This is a key feature of RBAC.

### Question 7
* What are the two types of locks that can be put on resources in Azure?
	* **Delete and Read-only**
	* Closed and Create-only
	* Delete and Closed
	* Update and Open

In Azure, locks can be put on resources to prevent accidental or nefarious actions. The two types of locks are Delete, which prevents the resource from being deleted, and Read-only, which prevents any changes to the resources.

### Question 8
* Which Microsoft service provides comprehensive information about trust in the Azure platform?
	* There isn't a single service, as trust is part of every service on Azure.
	* Azure Privacy Portal provides comprehensive information about trust in the Azure platform.
	* Azure User Safety Portal provides comprehensive information about trust in the Azure platform.
	* **Both Trust Center and Service Trust Portal provide comprehensive information about trust in the Azure platform.**

You can use the Trust Center to find documentation on all the various compliance standards Azure adheres to. You can use the Service Trust Portal to read the audit reports for any part of Microsoft's products, including Azure.
