### Question 89
* Which two features are available by using Azure Cost Management + Billing? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
	* **Create and manage budgets.**
	* **Generate historical reports and forecast future usage.**

Azure Cost Management allows you to create and manage cost and usage budgets by monitoring resource demand trends, consumption rates, and cost patterns. It also allows you to use historical data to generate reports and forecast future usage and expenditures.

### Question 90
* You need to recommend a solution for Azure virtual machine deployments. The solution must enforce company standards on the virtual machines. What should you include in the recommendation?
	* **Azure Policy**

Azure policies will allow you to enforce company standards on new virtual machines when combined with Azure VM Image Builder and Azure Compute Gallery. By using Azure Policy and role-based access control (RBAC) assignments, enterprises can enforce standards on Azure resources. But on virtual machines, these mechanisms only affect the control plane or the route to the virtual machine.

### Question 91
* What can you use to manage servers across third party cloud platforms and on-premises environments?
	* **Azure Arc**

Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform.

### Question 92
* Why is cloud computing often less expensive than on-premises datacenters?
	* **You are only billed for what you use.**

Renting compute and storage services and being billed for only what you use often lowers operating expenses. Depending on the service and the type of network bandwidth, charges can be incurred. Cloud service offerings often provide functionality that can be difficult or cost-prohibitive to deploy on-premises, especially for smaller organizations. Major cloud providers offer services around the world. Making it easy and relatively inexpensive to deploy services close to where your users reside.

### Question 93
* What uses the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud service model?
	* **Azure virtual machines**

Azure Virtual Machines is an IaaS offering. The customer is responsible for the configuration of the virtual machine as well as all operating system configurations. Azure App Services and Azure Cosmos DB are PaaS offerings. Microsoft Office 365 is a SaaS offering.

### Question 94
* What can you use to ensure that users authenticate by using multi-factor authentication (MFA) when they attempt to sign in from a specific location?
	* **Conditional Access**

Conditional Access can use signals to determine information about authentication attempts, and then determine whether to block access or require additional verifications, such as MFA.

### Question 95
* Which management layer accepts requests from any Azure tool or API and enables you to create, update, and delete resources in an Azure account?
	* **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**

ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in an Azure account.

### Question 96
* What can you use to find information about planned maintenance for Azure services that are critical to your organization?
	* **Azure Service Health**

You can drill down to the affected services, regions, and details to show how an event will affect you and what you must do. Most of these events occur without any impact to you and will not be shown. In a rare case that a reboot is required, Service Health allows you to choose when to perform the maintenance to minimize the downtime

### Question 97
* What are two characteristics of the public cloud deployment model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
	* **Servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.**
	* **Services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them.**

In a public cloud, services are offered over the internet and are available to anyone who wants to purchase them. A private cloud is limited to a single organization. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization.

### Question 98
* Which type of strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data?
	* **defense in depth**

A defense in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data. The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources. The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks.

### Question 99
* What can you use to ensure that new and existing Azure resources stay in compliance with corporate standards?
	* **Azure Policy**

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit resources. These policies enforce different rules across all resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.
