# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 14.6 - Practice Exam - 4

### Question 1
* Your company is migrating an internal web application to the cloud. The application requires specific configuration changes within the Operating System. Which of the following cloud deployment solutions would be most suitable?
	* Software as a Service (SaaS)
	* Function as a Service (FaaS)
	* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
	* Platform as a Service (PaaS)

(Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)) - Only Infrastructure as a Service provides the required level of access to the Operating System. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, but does not provide the same level of Operating System access as an IaaS solution. Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet but provides no access to the Operating System. Function as a Service (FaaS) such as Azure Functions are small single-purpose applications which do not provide Operating System access. Reference: [What is IaaS? Infrastructure as a Service | Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/overview/what-is-iaas/ "null")

### Question 2
* Which of the following is a correct statement regarding Azure?
	* Resource groups are used as a billing container for our Azure resource costs.
	* **Non-root management groups can have only a single parent management group and many child management groups.**
	* Azure accounts can only be associated with a single Azure subscription.
	* Management groups represent the billing entity for our Azure resource costs.

In Azure, any non-root management group can have only a single parent management group and many child management groups. In the case of the root management group, it doesn't have a parent management group since it is the top-level resource.

### Question 3
* You need to choose a performance option for an Azure storage account. This storage account will contain small blob objects used to train machine learning models, and it requires the fastest possible performance. Which performance option should you choose?
	* General-purpose v2
	* Premium file shares
	* **Premium block blobs**
	* Premium page blobs

Premium block blobs provide fast performance for block blob storage types (e.g., blob objects).

### Question 4
* What is the purpose of a resource lock in Azure?
	* Synchronize an on-premises AD server with Azure AD.
	* Manage authentication of Azure AD accounts based on conditions of the authentication attempt.
	* Enforce standards and restrictions in a subscription or resource group.
	* **Prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources.**

Locks can be applied to specific resources, resource groups, or subscriptions. They can either prevent deletion or modification of a resource regardless of user permissions.

### Question 5
* Llama Financial is our organization, and we are in charge of our cloud spend. At this time, we do not have a way to manage our cloud spend in an automated fashion. Which of the following tools could we use to automate management of our cloud spend on Azure?
	* TCO calculator
	* **Cost Management tool**
	* Pricing calculator
	* Subscriptions

The Cost Management tool in Azure is our central tool for managing our cloud spend in an automated fashion. Using the Cost Management tool, we can do things like create billing alerts to alarm us when our cloud spend exceeds a specified threshold.

### Question 6
* Your company, A Llama Guru, is becoming increasingly popular (why wouldn't it be?). You have to add more virtual machines to run your web facing application. What is the best way to ensure that traffic is distributed and that all virtual machines are being used optimally?
	* **Use Azure Load Balancer to distribute the inbound flow of internet traffic to a backend pool of virtual machines.**
	* Use a VPN Gateway to route secure and insecure requests to the appropriate virtual machine in your backend pool.
	* Use an Azure Application Gateway to recognize the application requested and guide the traffic to the appropriate machine.
	* Create a pool of identical virtual machines that can all take an equal share of the incoming requests.

(Use Azure Load Balancer to distribute the inbound flow of internet traffic to a backend pool of virtual machines.) - An Azure Load Balancer service is used to distribute all incoming requests to a web endpoint, and then guiding it to an instance in a backend pool of servers. Application Gateway is used to route traffic to specific VMs based on traffic properties such as the URL. A VPN Gateway is used to link Azure and your on-premises account securely as if on the same network. [What is Azure Load Balancer? - Azure Load Balancer | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview "null")

### Question 7

	* Microsoft 365
	* **Azure App Service**

Azure App Services provides an on-demand environment for application hosting without needing to manage the underlying operating system, including patching, storage, and configuration.

### Question 8
* What is the purpose of the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator on Azure?
	* **Estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your existing workloads to Azure**
	* Create accurate estimates of hourly or monthly Azure costs across the entire Azure portfolio
	* Monitors and analyzes the cost of your current Azure resources
	* Track your Azure environment's adherence to your company's compliance requirements

The Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator is used to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your existing workloads to Azure, which includes both savings realized from moving to VMs or migrating to other managed services.

### Question 9
* Our organization is really starting to grow within Azure. We have several subscriptions at this point, and managing access control to these subscriptions for a single Azure AD tenant is becoming cumbersome. Which of the following would allow our organization to manage access control to our Azure subscriptions?
	* Resource groups
	* Billing admin role assignment
	* **Management groups**
	* Access control cannot be managed between various subscriptions associated with our Azure tenant.

Management groups can be used to organize our subscriptions into an organizational hierarchy, so that we can granularly manage things, such as access control to the various subscriptions associated with our Azure AD tenant.

### Question 10
* When implementing passwordless authentication with Azure AD, what authentication methods are currently available to use?
	* Facebook Authenticator
	* **FIDO2 Security Key**
	* **Windows Hello**
	* **Microsoft Authenticator**

FIDO2 security keys are a hardware USB key used with passwordless and other MFA authentication. Windows Hello uses facial recognition on enabled Windows computers for passwordless authentication. To date, Microsoft Authenticator is the only smartphone MFA app that works with Azure AD's passwordless authentication methods.

### Question 11
* What is the aim of using Azure Functions in a serverless architecture on Azure?

	* `www.azureportal.com`
	* `portal.microsoftazure.com`
	* `console.azure.com`

(portal.azure.com) - The Azure Portal can be accessed from portal.azure.com in a web browser. The other URLs will not provide access to the Azure Portal. Be careful to only log in to the portal from a legitimate address. [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/ "null")

### Question 18
* How does passwordless authentication ease the burden of signing in with multi-factor authentication?
	* Passwordless authentication requires both a system password and multi-factor authentication from an approved device.
	* No password is required to log in, only a valid username.
	* A username is replaced by a secure PIN code.
	* **Removes the system password and replaces it with device authentication combined with biometrics/PIN.**

With passwordless authentication, the system login does not prompt for a password. Instead, it prompts for authentication from an approved device, usually with biometrics or a PIN code.

### Question 19
* What is the purpose of Log Analytics?

	* Implement a content delivery network to route URLs containing the "/image/" path.
	* Use a VPN Gateway to route URLs containing the "/image/" path.
	* Use Azure Load Balancer to route URLs containing the "/image/" path.
	* **Use an Application Gateway to route URLs containing the "/image/" path.**

(Use an Application Gateway to route URLs containing the "/image/" path.) - An Application Gateway is used specifically for routing traffic based on parameters in the traffic itself. This could be all requests to the "/images/" path of the URL being sent to a specific VM. A VPN Gateway is used to securely connect an Azure Virtual Network with an on-premises network. A CDN does not route traffic. A Load Balancer routes all traffic without looking at it. [What is Azure Application Gateway | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview "null")

### Question 21
* Your company is beginning the process of migrating their existing applications to Azure. A business-critical accounting application requires authentication with the NTLM protocol. This application will be migrated to a virtual machine in Azure. Any authentication solution must integrate into your existing on-premises Active Directory domain. What options are available for hosting this application in Azure while still authenticating with Active Directory?
	* Configure the application to authenticate using Azure AD credentials over single sign-on (SSO).
	* Configure the Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) service to act as an extension of your existing on-premises Active Directory domain. Configure the application to authenticate with your Azure AD DS managed service.
	* **Continue using your on-premises AD server, and synchronize the server with Azure AD over Azure AD Connect. Configure the application to authenticate with your on-premises AD server.**
	* **Configure an Azure VM with Windows Server, and operate as an Active Directory domain controller. Configure the application to authenticate with your VM-hosted AD server.**

One option is to simply continue hosting an on-premises AD server, if you are not removing all existing on-premises infrastructure. This is referred to as self-managed AD, where you are in charge of configuring and maintaining a Windows Server acting as a domain controller.

### Question 22
* Our organization is planning to use Azure. We have gathered from planning meetings that we will need to segment billing between various departments, such as marketing and human resources. Which of the following would be the best way to implement segmentation of billing for Azure?
	* **Create a separate subscription for each department under our Azure account.**
	* Create a separate Azure account for each department to use.
	* Create separate resource groups for each department to deploy their resources.

### Question 36
* What are some of the advantages of using a subnet with your Azure Virtual Network?
	* You can save costs by only using a part of the Virtual Network through a subnet.
	* Subnets contain security rules that allow or deny network traffic.
	* Virtual Machines will start faster, as the network provisioning is already done.
	* **You can secure a subnet individually from the entire virtual network.**
	* **You can logically group services on the same Virtual Network.**
	* **IP address allocation on the subnet is more efficient.**

(You can secure a subnet individually from the entire virtual network.) - Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. This makes address allocation more efficient, you can have a separate network security group for the subnet, and you can logically group services as well. (You can logically group services on the same Virtual Network.) - Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. This makes address allocation more efficient, you can have a separate network security group for the subnet, and you can logically group services as well. (IP address allocation on the subnet is more efficient.) - Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.
