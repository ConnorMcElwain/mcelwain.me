# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 13.6 - Service Lifecycle

### Gathering Customer Data
Customers can provide valuable feedback.

### Stages
* Preview
	* Private
		* Only available to specific customers invited by the product team behind the service
	* Public
		* Available to all Azure customers. Enable preview features in the Azure Portal
* General Availability
	* Available to all Azure customers as a normal service, including SLA. Services become generally available when they are ready. Can be a gradual rollout to some regions first

### Azure Updates
* Watch for previews, new features, and updates.
If you want to know when a service enters either preview or general availability, or when new features are added, you can monitor the update feed from Azure. This feed is updated very often and gives a single view of every change and new feature on Azure.
