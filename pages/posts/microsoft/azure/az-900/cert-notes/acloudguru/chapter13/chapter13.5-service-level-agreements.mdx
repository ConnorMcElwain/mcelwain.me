## Chapter 13.5 - Service Level Agreements

A service level agreement is a contract between a service provider and a client. It's an agreement on a certain level of service you can expect. If a service is not working for more than an agreed period of time in a month, you can claim compensation from Microsoft. You pay for an SLA, to ensure the least possible downtime of a service.
