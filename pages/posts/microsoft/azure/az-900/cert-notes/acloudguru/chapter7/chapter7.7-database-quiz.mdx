# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7.7 - Database Quiz

### Question 1
* Which of the following is a true statement regarding Microsoft SQL Server or Azure SQL?
	*  **Azure SQL is a managed service, meaning Azure takes care of all the infrastructure maintenance.**
	* Microsoft SQL Server is faster than Azure SQL.
	* Microsoft SQL Server is a managed service, meaning Azure takes care of all the infrastructure maintenance.
	* Azure SQL is faster than Microsoft SQL Server.

Azure SQL is a managed service, which means Microsoft takes care of all the hardware and maintenance tasks for running the database. You only have to worry about using the database for storing and retrieving data. There is no noticeable performance advantage with using either SQL service.

### Question 2
* Which of the following scenarios would be an ideal use case for Azure Database for MySQL?
	* **A legacy web application that needs to be modernized and migrated to the cloud.**
	* An organization needs a scalable database with no predefined schema to store sensor data.
	* A large enterprise requires a database capable of handling complex transactions and heavy analytical workloads with massive parallel processing.
	* **A gaming company needs a database with low latency for real-time player interactions.**

Azure Database for MySQL is a strong choice for migrating existing applications that already utilize MySQL. MySQL is a good option for low latency requirements in gaming applications.

### Question 3
* What are the primary advantages of using a database for storing data?
	* They are a much cheaper option than using regular Azure storage and offer more granular access management.
	* They are more secure for storing data than regular Azure storage and can store more data in less space due to compression algorithms.
	* **They offer the ability to sort and index data, and provide a powerful way of retrieving the data in the desired format.**
	* They offer the ability to sort and index data, but are less secure than regular Azure storage.

The main advantages of a database are how the data is sorted and indexed, as well as the flexibility in how to get the data out again. Databases are not necessarily cheaper, more secure, or more space efficient than other types of storage.

### Question 4
* What is a key advantage of Cosmos DB?
	* Backup facilities for other Azure services, such as App Services and Azure Functions
	* Improved Azure portal experience for managing various application locations
	* Cheap data storage
	* **Very low latency**

Cosmos DB is a globally scaled distributed database solution that offers very low latency, which is a key advantage. It is not primarily meant as a cheap storage service, nor for backup of data.

### Question 5
* What is a recommended use case for Azure SQL?
	* Update on-premises SQL Server to gain better performance and lower cost.
	* Migrate all instances of Microsoft SQL Server to Azure SQL to improve security and reduce cost.
	* **Migrate your on-premises SQL Server instances directly to Azure and get all the benefits of managed instances.**
	* Migrate Cosmos DB data if only a single geographical location is used.

Using Azure Database Migration Service, you can migrate directly from Microsoft SQL Server to Azure SQL. It is recommended by Azure to move your on-premises SQL Server instances to Azure SQL to improve efficiency and lower costs.
