## Chapter 1.4 - PowerShell

Just like the Azure CLI, PowerShell is all written text and it's considered a command-line interface.
- **Cmdlet** is a script that performs a specific task. "New-AzVm" creates a new Virtual Machine.
- **Azure Resource Manager** is utilized by PowerShell, like the Portal in Azure, to manipulate Azure resources.
- PowerShell is versatile, it's used for many other tasks and areas, not just for Azure.
