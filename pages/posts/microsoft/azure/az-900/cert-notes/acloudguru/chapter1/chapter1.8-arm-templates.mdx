## Chapter 1.8 - ARM Templates

### ARM Templates
* Describe Resource Usage
	* What are you updating, deleting, creating?
* Common Syntax
	* Defined language for all ARM templates, making it easier to formalize and learn
* Idempotent
	* Every ARM template can be applied multiple times, and the result is always the same
### Benefits
* Idempotent
	* Run the same templates once, twice, or as many times as you like. It will have the same outcome
* Source Control
	* Keep track of all changes to the ARM templates
* Reuse
	* Use a combination of multiple partial ARM templates to achieve glory -- or at least complex templates
* Declarative
	* Specify **what** you want, not **how** it is done
* No Human Errors
	* Automation means humans don't repeat the same mistakes
