* Downloaded application
* User-friendly graphical interface
	* Drag-and-drop interaction

### Azure File Sync
Synchronize Azure Files with On-Premises File Servers
Local file server performance + cloud availability
* Use cases:
	* Back up local file server
	* Synchronize files between multiple on-premises locations
	* Remote users access Azure Files
	* Transition to only Azure Files for file server
		* This is a good method to help ease your way into cloud only file server
