# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.11 - Authentication and Authorization Quiz

### Question 1
* If you have multiple applications in Azure Active Directory that you want users to access, which is the best way to handle user access?
	* Providing each user with a password for each app, as this is most secure
	* **Using single sign-on**
	* Using multi-factor authentication
	* Using the built-in premium authentication service

Single sign-on lets users use a single username and password to access all apps registered with Azure AD.

### Question 2
* Which is an authentication method used to verify a user with multi-factor authentication (MFA)?
	* Something you feel
	* Something you can recall quickly
	* Something you say
	* **Something you have**

Azure multi-factor authentication helps safeguard access to data and applications while maintaining simplicity for users. It provides additional security by requiring a second form of authentication and delivers strong authentication via a range of easy-to-use authentication methods, which are something you know, have, or are.

### Question 3
* What are the two main components of a Conditional Access policy?
	* Redundancy method and SKU
	* **Signals and Decisions**
	* Decisions and Redundancy method
	* SKU and Signals

Signals are the if/then conditions that determine if a policy is applied to a user login. When the signals, or conditions, of a Conditional Access policy are met, a decision is then made to either grant or block access, including requiring MFA at login.

### Question 4
* What is a definition of authorization?
	* Being able to log in to the Azure portal from anywhere.
	* **Determination of access to a system based on assigned roles/permissions**
	* Confirmation of your identity for a system
	* The ability of a system to determine your location when accessing it

Authorization determines your access to a system once you have been authenticated. This could be the right to access a certain part, create a new customer, or install new software.

### Question 5
* What is a preferred method of inviting an external user as a collaborator in your Azure AD environment?
	* **Invite their existing account as an external guest user.**
	* Enable scoped views of your tenant that are accessible to approved external users.
	* Azure AD does not allow for external users. All users must belong to the primary tenant organization.
	* Create a separate organization account for the external user.

Azure AD allows you to invite guest users with their existing user account assuming it can be authenticated with a variety of identity providers.

### Question 6
* Which type of management/protocol is not ideal for using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS)?
	* **OAuth 2.0**
	* Kerberos
	* Group Policy
	* NTLM

OAuth 2.0 is a modern authentication protocol that is usually handled by Azure Active Directory.

### Question 7
* What is a simple definition of the Zero Trust security model?
	* No users ever have access to resources because they are not trusted.
	* All users are assumed to be untrustworthy unless they are in a trusted location, like a corporate network.
	* Zero Trust is another name for Conditional Access policies.
	* **All users are assumed to be untrustworthy until proven otherwise using identity.**

Identity-based authorization enables the "work from anywhere" model and does not limit users to a "trusted perimeter" to access trusted resources.

### Question 8
* How does passwordless authentication ease the burden of signing in with multi-factor authentication?
	* No password is required to log in, only a valid username.
	* Passwordless authentication requires both a system password and multi-factor authentication from an approved device.
	* A username is replaced by a secure PIN code.
	* **Removes system password and replaces it with device authentication combined with biometrics/PIN.**

With passwordless authentication, the system login does not prompt for a password. Instead, it prompts for authentication from an approved device, usually with biometrics or a PIN code.
