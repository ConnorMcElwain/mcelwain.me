# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.10 - Summary

### Azure AD (AAD): A Central Component of Azure Authentication/Authorization
* AAD Is Fundamental!
	* You can't use Azure without AAD. AAD is not the same as Active Directory (AD)
* AAD Is First
	* The first service of every new account will be an AAD instance
* Tenant
	* Tenant = Organization
	* Single instance of AAD
	* A user account can be a member of a single tenant and can be a guest of up to 499 tenants
* Subscription
	* Billing entity that controls the cost of resources and services associated with it
* Hybrid Cloud
	* AAD can help you manage users in a hybrid cloud architecture between on-premises and in Azure

### Authentication/Authorization Topics
Zero Trust Concepts
* **Everyone** assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
	* Regardless of location
* Trusted **identities** vs. trusted locations
* Necessary for remote work
Multi-Factor Authentication
* Extra layer of security using something you **know**, something you **have**, and something you **are**
Conditional Access
* If/then policy for granting access (i.e., conditions)
* Centralized management
* Examples:
	* Require MFA
	* Require managed device
Passwordless Authentication
* Bridge gap between security and convenience
* Remove system password
	* Replace with something you have/are
* Methods:
	* Microsoft Authenticator
	* Windows Hello
	* FIDO2 hardware security key

External Guest Access
* External collaboration
* Invite external user with existing account
* Works with many identity providers
	* Microsoft/Google/Facebook
Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
* Managed instance of Active Directory (AD DS)
* Integrates with classic AD features
	* Kerberos, LDAP, NTLM, Group Policy
* One-way sync with Azure AD
* Requires separate domain
Single Sign-On
* Use single username and password to log in to multiple applications using AAD
