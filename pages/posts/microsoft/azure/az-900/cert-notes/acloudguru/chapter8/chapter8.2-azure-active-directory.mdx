# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.2 - Azure Active Directory

### Active Directory
* Traditional Office Use
	* Active Directory was designed for traditional office use with computers and printers
* What is "Web"?
	* The web as a concept or service was not part of the design for Active Directory. Web services were not part of the original vision for Active Directory in 2000
* Authentication
	* Active Directory authentication uses services that aren't available on Azure

Active Directory is **NOT** Azure Active Directory. They are not the same product, they're very different. It's **unlikely** you can transfer knowledge from one to the other.

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) Service
* Mandatory
	* You can't have an Azure account without an AAD service
* First User
	* Every Azure account needs a first user and this user is in the initial AAD instance

### Tenant
* Organization
	* A tenant represents the organization
* Dedicated AAD
	* A tenant is dedicated instance of AAD that an organization receives when signing up for Azure
* Separate
	* Each tenant is distinct and completely separate from other AAD tenants
* One User - One Tenant
	* Each user in Azure can only belong to a single tenant. Users **can be guests** of other tenants though

### Subscription
* Billing Entity
	* All resources within a subscription are billed together
* Cost Separation
	* You can have multiple subscriptions within a tenant to separate costs
* Payment
	* If a subscription isn't paid, all the resources and services associated with the subscription stop

### Hybrid Cloud Architecture
In a hybrid cloud architecture, you have some services on-premises and some services hosted on Azure. When you want to setup a hybrid cloud infrastructure, AAD can help manage your users both in the cloud on Azure and on your premises.

### Azure AD Now Part of Microsoft Entra
Microsoft Entra = New Product Family
* Includes all of Microsoft's identity and access capabilities
* Includes Azure AD, plus Permissions Management and Verified ID
* Exam perspective: Know that Azure AD is part of the broader Microsoft Entra product family

### Exam Tips
Manage users and permissions with Azure Active Directory.
* Active Directory(AD) is not the same as Azure Active Directory
* Different skillsets from AD to Azure AD
* Every Azure account will have an Azure AD service
* A tenant is a dedicated instance of Azure AD. It represents your organization in Azure
* A user belongs to a single tenant, but can be a guest in multiple
* A subscription is a billing entity. All resources belong to a single subscription
* Azure AD can help manage users in a hybrid cloud setup
