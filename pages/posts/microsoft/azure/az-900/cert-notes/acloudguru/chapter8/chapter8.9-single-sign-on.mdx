# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.9 - Single Sign-On

### Concept
One pair of credentials for multiple services. Microsoft does this with Outlook.com, Azure, Skype, the Microsoft store, and much more.

### Azure SSO
Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On
* Enable SSO in AAD
* Seamlessly use all applications without logging in
* Single username and password

### Example
A company has a number of applications for their staff. They have an HR app for managing their staff, a payroll system, a training portal, and an app to order equipment/supplies. All of these apps are connected to Azure AD for authentication. The company's users are all in Azure AD, and the company has enabled SSO in AAD (Azure Active Directory) as well. Each user can now get access to the apps they need, all using the same username and password through SSO in Azure AD.
