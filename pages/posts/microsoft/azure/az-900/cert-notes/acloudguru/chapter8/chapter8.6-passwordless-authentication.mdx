## Chapter 8.6 - Passwordless Authentication

### Security vs. Convenience: The Never-Ending Conflict
Multi-Factor Authentication is More Secure, But Less Convenient
* More steps require to log in
	* Password and device/biometrics
	* Increased user frustration:
		* If everything is not working as expected
		* Overall, less convenient

### Passwordless Authentication: One Possible Solution
Objective: Increase Convenience While Staying Secure
* Password only = More convenient, but less secure
* Password + MFA = Higher security, but inconvenient
* Passwordless Authentication = High security and convenient
	* Remove password from system login
	* Replace with:
		* Something you have (phone/key fob)
		* Something you know/are (on device)
			* Fingerprint/face unlock/PIN

### Passwordless Authentication Methods
Microsoft Authentication App
* Microsoft's MFA mobile app
	* Configure in Azure AD
* Authenticate in app with biometrics/PIN
Windows Hello
* Face recognition in Windows
FIDO2 Security Key
* Hardware key

### Example Passwordless Login Scenario
* Log in to Microsoft 365, and enter your username.
* Instead of a password, you are prompted to check Microsoft Authenticator.
* Use  the biometric/PIN in the Authenticator app to confirm authentication
* Confirm numerical challenge in the Authenticator app
