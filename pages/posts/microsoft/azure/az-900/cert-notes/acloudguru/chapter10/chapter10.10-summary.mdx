## Chapter 10.10 - Summary

### Security Summary
* Defense in Depth
	* You need multiple layers of defense for your infrastructure. Azure has physical, identity, perimeter, network, compute, gateways and firewalls, and data as protection layers
* Securing Network Connectivity
	* A firewall controls the data coming and out of a network based on rules. Azure protects against DDoS attacks with no downtime to you. A network security group protects a subnet or virtual machine
* Public and Private Endpoints
	* Most Azure PaaS services are publicly reachable by default. Private endpoints enable private access to PaaS services. Can also disable public access for truly private services

* Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center)
	* Monitor security hygiene for VMs. Define policies to protect your resources better and respond to incidents
* Azure Key Vault
	* A secure way to share access to applications and resources with third parties without ever revealing any credentials
* Azure Information Protection
	* Share files and data inside and outside of Azure and still maintain control over that data. You can control who views, edits, prints, and more

* Azure Sentinel
	* Collect, aggregate, analyze, and present security issues automatically for you to take action
* Azure Dedicated Hosts
	* Your own dedicated Azure hardware to install Windows, Linux, or SQL Server VMs on. Gives you control without losing cloud benefits like scaling, scale sets, fault isolation, and availability zones
* Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Advanced Threat Protection)
	* You secure and manage users of your organization. Monitor users' behavior, create a baseline of this behavior, and report on any anomalies from it
