# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10.2 - Securing Networking Connectivity

### Firewall
* Rules
	* A firewall defines rules for what kind of traffic can and cannot access the device or service behind it
* Variations
	* Firewalls comes as hardware and software versions. They can suit any type and size of network
* Critical Part
	* Any network that take security serious will have a firewall

### Distributed Denial of Service Attacks - History
* U.S. Banks
	* In 2012, 6 U.S. banks were flooded with 60Gb of traffic every second
* CloudFlare
	* In 2014, CloudFlare was attacked with 400Gb of traffic per second
* GitHub
	* In 2018 GitHub experienced 1.35Tb of traffic per second. A new record for DDoS attacks

### DDoS Protection Service
* Many Internet-Connected Devices
	* A lot of computers and other connected devices target a single website to make it stop. GitHub had a 127M requests per second attack
* Protection
	* Detects the DDoS attack and deflects it. Various levels of protection depending on scenario
* No Downtime
	* There is no interruption to your service at all. Azure will mitigate the attack globally

### Network Security Groups (NSG)
* Resource Firewall
	* Personal resource firewall. Attach to virtual network, subnet or network interface
* Rules
	* A NSG determines who can access the resources attached to it, using rules for inbound and outbound traffic

### Network Security Group
For example, if you have a virtual machine that's on a virtual network, the network can be behind a firewall protecting everything on the network, and then the VM can have its own network security group to define specific rules for just that machine.

### Application Security Groups
* Protects Application Infrastructure
	* Focus the security on the application rather than the IP endpoint
* Natural Extension
	* Group VMs and virtual networks into logical application groups and apply an application security group
