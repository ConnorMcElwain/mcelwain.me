# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 10.3 - Public and Private Endpoints

### Public Endpoints = Publicly Reachable PaaS Services
Default: Managed (PaaS) services reachable over the public internet
* Virtual network -> PaaS over public internet
* Also exposed to the public
* Problem with sensitive resources
What if we want to limit or remove public exposure?
Solution: Two available solutions: "Good" and "Better"
* "Good" = service endpoints
* "Better" = private endpoints

### Service Endpoints: "Good" Solution
Privately connect VNet subnet to Azure PaaS services
* Direct connection from subnet to Azure PaaS services
* Connects over Microsoft's private backbone (not over public internet)

Configure service to only allow traffic from service endpoint-enabled subnet
* Can also restrict access to specific public IP addresses

### Limitations of Service Endpoints
* Secure access to VNets **only**
	* No private on-premises access
	* Must allow on-premises access over public IP
* PaaS public endpoint still exists
	* Not truly private
* Service endpoints provide access to an entire service
	* For example, provides private access to all of Azure Storage, not just a single storage account

### Private Endpoint: "Better" Solutions
Managed network interface
* Private connection to specific instance of a service
* e.g., single storage account, SQL instance, etc

Available over connected networks
* Hybrid/on-premises networks
* Peered virtual networks

Can completely disable public access to a connected service
* Truly private
* Public endpoint disabled

### Scenario
VPN connection from home office to an Azure VNet named 'hub-vnet'

Must privately access sensitive Azure SQL database from home office
* Disable public internet exposure

Solution: A private endpoint
* Privately connects **hub-vnet** to Azure SQL database
* Private access from home office
* Can also disable public access for truly private connection
