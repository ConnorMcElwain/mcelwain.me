# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 4.7 - Functions

### What are Azure Functions?
* IaaS/PaaS vs Function
	* IaaS/PaaS
		* Install your own applications
		* Access to the operating system
		* Resource visibility
		* An app service has no OS access, but has resource access
	* Function
		* Smallest compute service on Azure
		* A single function of compute
		* Called, or invoked, via a standard web address
		* Runs once and stops

### Architecture
* VM
	* No maintenance
	* No processes
	* Nothing VM related

### Function Benefits 
* Only Runs When Needed
	* The Azure Function only runs when there is data to process. No traffic = no resource usage
* Saves Money
	* No resources running means you don't pay for the function when it's not used
* Resilience
	* If your function fails, it doesn't affect other function instances
