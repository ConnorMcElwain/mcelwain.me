## Chapter 4 - Virtual Machines

### What is a Virtual Machine?
A virtual machine is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. They are based on computer architectures and provide the same functionality as a physical machine.

### Features
* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
	* Manage everything except the hardware. This includes the network components
* Tools
	* Use the Azure Portal to manage large numbers of VMs and even hybrid clouds
* Compliance
	* Use Azure blueprints to make your VMs comply with company guidelines
* Recommendations
	* Azure will recommend improvements to ensure better security, higher availability, and greater performance
* Choice
	* Choose amount of RAM, number of CPUs, Windows or Linux

### Pricing
* Calculated Hourly
	* The more CPUs, GPUs, and amount of RAM you want, the more you pay per hour

### Use Cases
* Pros:
	* Control
		* Use virtual machines when you need to control all aspects of an environment or machine
	* Application
		* Install specific applications on your Windows or Linux machines
	* Existing Infrastructure
		* You can move existing resources and virtual machines to Azure from on-premises or another cloud provider
* Cons:
	* Not for Everything
		* If you can use another Azure service instead, it is often worth it
	* Maintenance
		* A lot of maintenance with VMs. Operating system updates, patches, security concerns

### Exam Tips
Virtual Machines are at the core of Azure compute and are widely used.
* A virtual machine is  your machine exclusively
* You don't buy, own or control any hardware. Azure does this
* Virtual machines are an IaaS offering where you are responsible for the entire machine
* Azure virtual machines take advantage of Azure tools
* Pricing goes up as resources go up, and you pay by the hour
