### Compute Summary
* Virtual Machines
	* Virtualized hardware you control. Spin up ad down as needed. Take advantage of the Azure tools available. Priced per hour with many configurations available.

	* Sets of identical VMs. Scale sets automatically create and delete VMs for your application. Provides high availability and protects against server failures
* App Services
	* Managed platform to host your applications. Web app, containers and API. Supports a lot of programming languages
* Azure Container Instances
	* Hosts and runs your containers on Azure. Containers have less overhead than virtual machines and can be deployed consistently
* Azure Kubernetes Service
	* Open-source tool for orchestrating and managing many container images and applications. Uses clusters and pods to scale and deploy applications
* Windows Virtual Desktop
	* 100% virtualized Windows 10. Access with any device that has a browser and internet connection. Reuse licenses to save some money
* Functions
