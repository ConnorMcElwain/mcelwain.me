# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 4.9 - Compute Quiz

### Question 1
* Which of the following represents the common application types hosted on Azure App Service?
	* Web Apps, Web App for Linux, and API Apps
	* Web Apps, Event Grid for App Services, and API Apps
	* **Web Apps, Web App for Containers, and API Apps**
	* Web Apps, Azure Standard Apps, and API Apps

Azure App Service commonly hosts Web Apps, which allows easy deployment of web-based applications in various languages, Web App for Containers, which simplifies the deployment of container-based web applications, and API Apps, which is specifically used for building apps that will host APIs (application programming interfaces) used by other applications.

### Question 2
* Your company suddenly has a bunch of new remote employees, who all need a Windows environment to work from. Which is the best Azure solution to get them up and running quickly?
	* Virtual machine with Windows 10
	* **Azure Virtual Desktop (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop)**
	* Preconfigured laptop devices that connect directly to Azure VMs
	* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Virtual Desktop (formerly Windows Virtual Desktop) helps you quickly set up an environment, and even lets you reuse any existing Windows 10 licenses you have.

### Question 3
* What are some benefits of using a Virtual Machine on Azure, compared to using your own on-site physical server?
	*   Owning the hardware but Azure maintains it
	* Always much cheaper than running your own servers
	* **No maintenance of hardware and only paying for what you use**
	* Applications have much better performance running on comparable virtual machines.

Virtual machines on Azure abstract away the physical hardware layer, so you don't need to worry about maintaining physical hardware. Microsoft handles this instead.

### Question 4
* What is a key characteristic of an Azure Function?
	*   It is a foundational component of any Azure infrastructure.
	* **It is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs.**
	* It is an add-on to any paid Azure subscription that allows using Azure services as functions in your applications.
	* It is a function to update any resources on Azure.

"Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

### Question 5
* Which definition best describes compute on Microsoft Azure?
	* An optional component to improve the efficiency of Azure
	* A virtual machine
	* Any serverless service, such as Azure Functions
	* **Any service that performs or enables a computation**

Compute is one of three foundational components of cloud computing. The other two are network and storage. This means any service that performs a compute function on Azure is part of "Compute" on Azure. It isn't a single service.

### Question 6
* What is a fully managed platform on Azure?
	* Every part of your Azure services are looked after by Microsoft. This means you don't have to worry about your application development.
	* You can pay a monthly fee to have Microsoft look after the maintenance of your applications and services on Azure.
	* A fully managed platform on Azure is a specific subscription that provides extra support for your Azure services.
	* **Servers, network, storage, and more are all managed by Azure. You focus on your business value and logic.**

A fully managed platform means the provider manages the infrastructure layer, such as VMs, disks, networks, and more. You only have to focus on the core functionality of your application. Fully managed services on Azure are available on all subscription types and come at no extra cost.

### Question 7
* Which cloud service model do virtual machines belong to?
	* Software as a Service
	* Serverless
	* Platform as a Service
	* **Infrastructure as a Service**

Infrastructure as a Service includes services that emulate hardware, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage.

### Question 8
* What is a scale set?
	* **A set of individual virtual machines that can be configured and managed as a single group**
	* A set of virtual machines running in the same data center
	* A range of sizes of virtual machines ready to take over a workload
	* A set of similar services that all work together for a service or application

Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.
