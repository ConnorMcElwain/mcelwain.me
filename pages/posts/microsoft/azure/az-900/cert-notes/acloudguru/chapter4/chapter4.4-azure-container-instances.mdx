## Chapter 4.4 - Azure Container Instances

### Features
* Manage Application Dependencies
	* All the dependencies for an application are included in the container image. You can manage the application and its dependencies with confidence
* Less Overhead
	* Virtual machines require a lot more maintenance and updates. Containers don't have any components relating to the operating system that require maintenance
* Increased Portability
	* Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms
* Efficiency
	* Development, deployment, and maintenance are all more efficient when using containers. Scaling and patching is much simpler
* Consistency
	* The operations team can rely on containers being the same every time, no matter which target they are being deployed to

### Workflow
