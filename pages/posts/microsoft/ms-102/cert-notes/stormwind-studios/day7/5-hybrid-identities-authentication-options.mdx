# MS-102 Certification Notes
## Day 7.5 - Hybrid Identities Authentication Options

### Authentication for Synchronized Identities
* Managed - Domain managed by Microsoft
	* PHS - Password Hash Synchronized
	* PTA - Pass Through Authentication
* Federated - Log in Through Identity Provider
	* ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)
		* ADFS is a Microsoft-developed SSO solution that provides a unified authentication experience to employees
	* SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
		* SAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider
	* WS-Federation
		* WS-Federation is a protocol that provides mechanisms for connecting users and resources across security boundaries, typically in disparate security realms, creating a federation of security realms
	* Third party Identity Providers

### PHS
* Password Hash Synchronization aka PHS
	* Hash of a hash of password sent to Entra ID (Azure AD)
	* Authentication happens to Entra ID (Azure AD)
	* Same Sign On
	* Users only need to remember one password
	* On-premises password policies enforced
	* Can Enable Password Writeback
	* Supports premium features of Identity Protection

### PTA
* Pass-Through Synchronization aka PTA
	* AD DS performs Authentication
	* Password validation done by on-premises software agents
	* No password information stored in Entra ID (Azure AD)
	* Supports smart Card Authentication
	* Some other forms of MFA
	* Can specify a custom port for the PTA Agent
	* On premise Password Policies enforced
	* Can Enable Password Writeback
	* Immediate enforcement of on-prem account states
	* Supports sign-in hours

### Federated
* Federated - Authentication handled by trusted Authentication System
	* ADFS - Active Directory Federated Services (Microsoft Product)
	* SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language
	* WS-Federation - Web Services Federation
	* Third Party Identity Providers

### ADFS
* ADFS
	* True Single Sign On
	* Fairly Complex architecture
	* Infrastructure investments
	* Ability to use on-premises AD for Authentication
	* Supports On Premise MFA

### SAML, WS-Federation
* SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language
	* Authentication assertion - identifies user
	* Attribution assertion - SAML token contains data about the user
	* Authorization decision assertion - information about allow or deny for bad credentials or permissions
* WS-Federation - Web Services Federation
	* Protocols that support a wide range of scenarios for trusted identity providers

### Third Party Providers
* Microsoft no longer provides certified non-Microsoft identity providers, however several are used successfully and integrated with Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
